parents: Walter and Edith E. Clark, of 9 Warwick Place in 1901, 162 Upper Fant Road in 1911 with 6 rooms. Here is 162 Upper Fant Road Later they moved to 286, Upper Fant Rd., Maidstone.  They had 4 sons and 1 daughter Walter, William, Sidney, Isabel and Herbert.  In 1911 William’s father Walter was employed as a Dairyman.  William was baptised on 12th October 1900.

I had difficulties finding his grave as he does not have the usual headstone from Commonwealth War Graves Commission (CWGC). I queried this with CWGC and they sent their local representatives to look for William’s grave. His grave has a Gallipoli marker as you can see in this photograph.
