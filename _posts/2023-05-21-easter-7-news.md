*A very warm welcome* to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul, our celebrant
this morning, who will also kindly be saying Mass for us on Thursday at
10.30 am. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall
after the service, so that we can welcome you properly.

**A Fashion Show with a Difference! MADM (local charity Making a
Difference Maidstone)** **is organising a Fashion Show of formal/bridal
wear at MidKent College on Friday 26th May.** All the outfits shown
will be secondhand -- a chance to address the cost of living crisis, to
encourage recycling, to raise money for MADM -- and to see how glamorous
a quality second-hand fashion item can be! Refreshments will be
available, admission is free, and donations on the day will be much
appreciated. There is actually going to be a **pop-up shop!** There will
be two sessions -12.30 pm and 2 pm -- and you can make sure of a place
if you reserve your **free ticket** by scanning the QR code on the
poster in the narthex. This show will go on for just under an hour and
is in our own locality (Oakwood Road) -- do support it if you can!
