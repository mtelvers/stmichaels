A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
Today we celebrate Corpus Christi. But what is Corpus Christi? – The Festival where we give thanks for the
Institution of the Eucharist, the Mass, wherein we encounter Christ in Word and Sacrament; for Jesus’ real presence
with us in the Sacrament of the Altar; and for all the Blessings we receive from Him as we kneel before him in
homage and prayer to receive His Body and His Blood.

St Michael’s Church Summer Fete - Saturday 5th July. There is a box near the entrance to the Ascension chapel
for donations for the various stalls and activities – especially prizes for the Tombola and Raffle. If you can contribute
to or help with other stalls – plants and gardening, books and toys, cakes, crafts and gifts – have a word with Alison
Heywood or the stall organiser.

                               Note the date – come and enjoy – invite your friends !!

        Last year’s Christmas Market was an astounding success – let’s make it the same this Summer !!

Our Churchwardens: On Tuesday 1st July Jonathan and Zoe will be admitted to office as our Churchwardens for this
year at a service at St Nicholas Church Allington, starting at 7pm and led by our new Interim Archdeacon. The service
is open to all, and it would be lovely if a good number of us attended to show our support for Jonathan and Zoe.

Other forthcoming events:

Folkestone Blessing of the Fisheries with Bishop Luke: Sunday 29th June. Notice at Back of Church. There will be
a list at Back of Church for those wishing to go, to facilitate sharing of travel arrangements.

The Society Pilgrimage to Aylesford Priory: Saturday 30th August, Preacher Fr Ben Eadon, Priest Administrator at
Walsingham.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: For growth in commitment to the Eucharist and devotion to Our Lord in the Most Holy
Sacrament of the Altar. That the Church will be courageous in taking Christ into the world and making his love
known. For the Blessing of the Fisheries event at Folkestone. For peace and justice in the world; in Ukraine, in Gaza,
between Israel and Iran, in Sudan, and in all other places of hatred and violence.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington, and Fr Derek Mottershead.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Helen Atkinson, Betty Stevens, Joyce
Worsfold.
