***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul
Matthias, our celebrant this morning, who will also kindly be saying
Mass for us on **Thursday at 10.30 am.** If you are new to St
Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we
can welcome you properly.

**Welcome, too, to Harry,** whose Baptism takes place during this
morning\'s Mass. We assure him of our support and our prayers as he sets
out on his Christian journey.

**Thank you so much to all who joined the Garden Working Party
yesterday, and to Martyn for arranging it.** It was a sunny and
companionable morning, and you have really made a difference!

**The Maidstone Deanery Roadshow** **at** **St Luke\'s, Maidstone, on
October 16th at 7 pm - what is it?** Deanery Roadshows are a chance
for parishes to learn about the financial plans of the diocese and how
they will affect the deanery and its parishes. Those present can ask
questions and, indeed, make representations about financial matters that
concern them. Recently St Michael\'s has made its presence felt, and its
voice heard, on these occasions. Please note the date and try to come
along.

**Flowers in church:** Members of the congregation sometimes wish to
dedicate a flower arrangement in church in memory of a loved one. If you
would like to do this, please have a word with Margaret G., who can
provide information and help.

**We shall be welcoming the St Michael\'s Schools for their
Michaelmas-and-Harvest Service** on Friday, 29th September, at 9.30
am. Please, after today\'s Mass, can you kindly move kneelers out of the
way to maximise the available space, and see that all books are returned
to the back of church?

**The Family Trust** -- which focuses on encouraging children and young
people to explore the Christian faith -- seeks to appoint a new Schools
Worker to join its team in this part of Kent. A rewarding opportunity
for service and mission! Details at
<https://www.familytrust.org.uk/join-our-team>.

**Choral Evensong** often speaks not only to active Anglicans but to
many people whose links with the Church are far less definite.
**Everyone** **will be welcome** **at Choral Evensong at St Michael\'s
on Sunday, 29th October,** with a gathered choir conducted by Gareth
James. Do pass the word around!

**Don\'t forget our Michaelmas Lunch** next Sunday, 1st October! If
you are able and willing to bring a contribution of food, please sign up
on the pink list at back of church. T**hank you to Alison and all the
other angels** who are helping to make this a joyful occasion for
everyone! **All are welcome.**

**Our Harvest Thanksgiving** will be just a week later, on October
8th. Everyone is invited to enjoy a glass of wine and cake after Mass.
Please, if you can, come to church with an offering of food to be
delivered to the Christian Care Foodbank in Knightrider Street.
Imperishable food is most welcome, but so is fresh garden produce.
**Thank you in advance for your generosity** -- particularly appreciated
in these difficult times.
