A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael's. If you are new to St Michael's, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so we can welcome
you properly.

**SERVICES THIS WEEK:** Mass on Thursday at 10.30am (St Benedict of
Nursia). Next Sunday Sung Mass for Trinity 7 at 10.30am, with a focus on
the Revd John Keble and the Oxford Movement.

**SAINTS' DAYS THIS WEEK:** This Saturday is the memorial in the Church
of England of the Reformation martyrs St Thomas More and St John Fisher.
Thomas More was born in 1478, studied classics and law and was called to
the Bar at the age of 23. His talents and integrity impressed Henry VIII
who appointed him as his Chancellor. However, Thomas could not support
the King in his break with Rome and he was imprisoned and then executed
on 6th July 1535 for refusing to acknowledge the King as the supreme
head of the Church in England. John Fisher was a close friend of Thomas,
he reformed the life of the University of Cambridge and was made Bishop
of Rochester, where he proved an effective pastoral Bishop. He was
admired by Henry VIII until he too could not stomach the King declaring
himself supreme head of the Church in England in place of the Pope,
whereupon John was imprisoned and executed two weeks before Thomas. We
in the Church of England still live with the legacy of Henry's decision
to split from Rome (which was initially entirely about power and
control, and not about fundamental doctrine -- though it paved the way
for divergence in matters of faith and doctrine).

Thursday 11th is the Festival of St Benedict of Nursia, Abbot of Monte
Casino and Father of Western Monasticism, who died ca 550. Next Sunday
the Church remembers John Keble, Priest, poet and a leader of the Oxford
Movement.

**LATER TODAY, SUNDAY** there is the Blessing of the Fisheries ceremony
at St Peter's Folkstone at 3pm, followed by tea. All welcome -- I know
some of you enjoy this event and are planning to go again this year.

**THE PCC** meet on Wednesday of this week at 7.30pm.

**DATE FOR THE DIARY:** The annual Canterbury FiF BBQ at St Michael's
Harbledown is on Sunday 28th July starting at 3pm and ending with
Evensong and Benediction at 6pm. We enjoy very strong links with St
Michael's Harbledown, they had a strong representation at my Licensing
Service and Fr Peter there has been very encouraging to me in my
ministry here -- so it would be good to have a strong contingent from St
Michael's Maidstone to join in that enjoyable afternoon. If you need a
lift, or want to do some car-sharing, please let me know.

**PRAYERS FOR THE SICK AND THOSE IN NEED.** Forms are now available at
the back of church for requesting names to be included on our prayer
list. If you wish prayers for yourself or someone you know, or for a
particular situation, just fill in a Prayer Request form and pop it into
the post box at the back of church. Names will be prayed for at Mass on
Sunday and Thursday.

**FOR OUR PRAYERS:** This week in our National life we pray for our
new Government; in the wider world we pray for peace in places of
war including Ukraine, Sudan and Gaza, and for those affected by the
devastation in the Caribbean; in our Church life we pray for our PCC
meeting this coming week.

We pray for all those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis
Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Ellie Pointer, Rue McGeouch,
Frank Carr, Lindsay Wheeler, Peter Rowe, William Danes-Volkov, Martyn
Nash and Fran.

We pray for the recently departed, for all those who faithfully
served God in this place in previous generations, and for those who's
year's mind occurs this Sunday and in the coming week: Helen Bird,
Christine Strachan, Robert Hickmott, Reginald Rust, Joyce Banfield and
Irene Horton
