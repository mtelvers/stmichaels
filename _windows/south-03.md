“The angel appeared to him in a dream.” The troubled Joseph, sitting at night in his carpenter’s shop, has dozed off with a rolled scroll on his bench – perhaps the prophecy of Isaiah, which Matthew quotes immediately after this episode. Note the details of the workshop – down to the wood shavings on the floor. The angel, again bearing a herald’s wand, brings a message of reassurance: Joseph should bring Mary home as his wife, because her pregnancy has come about through the Holy Spirit (Matthew 1).
