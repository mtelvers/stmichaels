**FOURTH SUNDAY OF EASTER Hymns 111, 296, 114, 124**

**FIRST READING Acts 2.42-47** They devoted themselves to the apostles'
teaching and fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. Awe
came upon everyone, because many wonders and signs were being done by
the apostles. All who believed were together and had all things in
common; they would sell their possessions and goods and distribute the
proceeds to all, as any had need. Day by day, as they spent much time
together in the temple, they broke bread at home and ate their food with
glad and generous hearts, praising God and having the goodwill of all
the people. And day by day the Lord added to their number those who were
being saved.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 23**

**Response: The Lord is my shepherd: there is nothing I shall want.**

1\. The Lord is my shepherd; there is nothing I shall want.  
Fresh and green are the pastures where he gives me repose.  
Near restful waters he leads me: to revive my drooping spirit. **R.**

2\. He guides me along the right path: he is true to his name.  
If I should walk in the valley of darkness no evil would I fear:  
You are there with your crook and your staff; with these you give me
comfort. **R**

3\. You have prepared a banquet for me: in the sight of my foes.  
My head you have anointed with oil: my cup is overflowing. **R.**

4\. Surely goodness and kindness shall follow me: all the days of my life.  
In the Lord's own house shall I dwell: for ever and ever. **R.**

**SECOND READING 1 Peter 2.19-25** For it is to your credit if, being
aware of God, you endure pain while suffering unjustly. If you endure
when you are beaten for doing wrong, where is the credit in that? But if
you endure when you do right and suffer for it, you have God's approval.
For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you,
leaving you an example, so that you should follow in his steps. 'He
committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.' When he was
abused, he did not return abuse; when he suffered, he did not threaten;
but he entrusted himself to the one who judges justly. He himself bore
our sins in his body on the cross, so that, free from sins, we might
live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed. For you were
going astray like sheep, but now you have returned to the shepherd and
guardian of your souls.

**GOSPEL John 10.1-10** 'Very truly, I tell you, anyone who does not
enter the sheepfold by the gate but climbs in by another way is a thief
and a bandit. The one who enters by the gate is the shepherd of the
sheep. The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep hear his
voice. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out. When he has
brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him
because they know his voice. They will not follow a stranger, but they
will run from him because they do not know the voice of strangers.'
Jesus used this figure of speech with them, but they did not understand
what he was saying to them. So again Jesus said to them, 'Very truly, I
tell you, I am the gate for the sheep. All who came before me are
thieves and bandits; but the sheep did not listen to them. I am the
gate. Whoever enters by me will be saved, and will come in and go out
and find pasture. The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy. I
came that they may have life, and have it abundantly.
