Hymns 420, 338, 44 234

**FIRST READING Malachi 3.1-5** See, I am sending my messenger to
prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come
to his temple. The messenger of the covenant in whom you
delight---indeed, he is coming, says the Lord of hosts. But who can
endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he
is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap; he will sit as a
refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of
Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings
to the Lord in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem
will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former
years. Then I will draw near to you for judgement; I will be swift to
bear witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against
those who swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired workers in
their wages, the widow, and the orphan, against those who thrust aside
the alien, and do not fear me, says the Lord of host**s.**

**SECOND READING Hebrews 2.14-18** Since, therefore, the children share
flesh and blood, he himself likewise shared the same things, so that
through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that
is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery
by the fear of death. For it is clear that he did not come to help
angels, but the descendants of Abraham. Therefore he had to become like
his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he might be a
merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make a
sacrifice of atonement for the sins of the people. Because he himself
was tested by what he suffered, he is able to help those who are being
tested.

**GOSPEL Luke 2.22-40** When the time came for their purification
according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to
present him to the Lord (as it is written in the law of the Lord, 'Every
firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord'), and they
offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord,
'a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons.'

Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was
righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and
the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy
Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's
Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the
parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary
under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,

'Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace, according to your
word;

for my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared in the
presence of all peoples,

a light for revelation to the Gentiles and for glory to your people
Israel.'

And the child's father and mother were amazed at what was being said
about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, 'This
child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and
to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many
will be revealed--- and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'

There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband for seven
years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She
never left the temple but worshipped there with fasting and prayer night
and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak
about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.
When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they
returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and
became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon him.

Dear Friends,

Thank you so much for the lovely card you signed which arrived with me
this week -- the photographs of the church on the front are stunning,
and show what a special place St Michael's is. I am looking forward very
much to being amongst you and to sharing the next phase of life and
ministry at St Michael and All Angels with you. 

Maidstone will be completely new to me, so there will be the excitement
of exploring new places, learning about the history and culture of the
area, getting to know you all, including the schools and care homes -
and finding the best walks for Rosa, my 6-year old Lurcher rescue dog. So
I'm hoping for some dry weather !!

I look forward to meeting as many of you as possible at my Licensing
Service (21st March) and it will be very special just a few days later
for us to walk through Holy Week and Easter together at the very
beginning of my ministry here.  I also have the dates of the August
Walsingham Pilgrimage in my diary and I hope that this, too, will be
something which many of us will be able to enjoy together as we worship,
relax and build friendships in that wonderful, Holy place.

My prayer is that as we go forward into this next phase in the life of
St Michael's, each one of us will encounter Christ afresh in Word and
Sacrament, to be renewed in faith and hope and love to be His people in
the world -- to bring the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ into
every part of our parish community and beyond.  And to do it with joy !!

With my prayers,

***Fr. John***
