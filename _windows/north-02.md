“What aileth thee, Hagar?” Abraham has become the father of a son, Isaac, by his wife Sarah. His Egyptian slave-woman, Hagar, had previously borne him a son, Ishmael. A family disagreement has led Abraham to turn out Hagar, with Ishmael, into the wilderness, where Hagar leaves her child under a bush and moves away to avoid seeing him die of thirst (note the empty water-bottle). An angel calls to her “out of heaven”, telling her that God has heard the child’s cries and that Ishmael will be the ancestor of a great nation (traditionally the Arabs). She then sees “a well of water” (note the glimpse of blue water to the right of Hagar), and the wanderers drink and survive. Ishmael is shown here almost as an adolescent (a previous passage puts his age at 13), whereas the actual text of this episode suggests that he was a child in arms (Genesis 21).
