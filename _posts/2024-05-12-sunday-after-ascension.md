**SUNDAY AFTER ASCENSION Hymns NEH 130, 352, 296, 134**

**FIRST READING (Acts 1.15-17,21-26)** *A reading from the Acts of the
Apostles:* In those days Peter stood up among the believers (together
the crowd numbered about one hundred and twenty people) and said,
'Friends, the scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit
through David foretold concerning Judas, who became a guide for those
who arrested Jesus--- for he was numbered among us and was allotted his
share in this ministry.' So one of the men who have accompanied us
throughout the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up
from us---one of these must become a witness with us to his
resurrection.' So they proposed two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was
also known as Justus, and Matthias. Then they prayed and said, 'Lord,
you know everyone's heart. Show us which one of these two you have
chosen to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which
Judas turned aside to go to his own place.' And they cast lots for them,
and the lot fell on Matthias; and he was added to the eleven apostles.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 1** ***Response: Happy are they who trust in the
Lord.***

1 Happy are they who have not walked in the counsel of the wicked,  
nor lingered in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seats of the  
scornful!  

2 Their delight is in the law of the Lord,  
and they meditate on his law day and night.*** R***

3 They are like trees planted by streams of water, bearing fruit in due season,  
with leaves that do not wither; everything they do shall  
prosper. ***R***

4 It is not so with the wicked:  
they are like chaff which the wind blows away;  

5 Therefore the wicked shall not stand upright when judgement comes,  
nor the sinner in the council of the righteous.  

6 For the Lord knows the way of the righteous,  
but the way of the wicked is doomed. ***R***

**SECOND READING 1 John 5.9-13** *A reading from the first Letter of
John:* If we receive human testimony, the testimony of God is greater;
for this is the testimony of God that he has testified to his Son. Those
who believe in the Son of God have the testimony in their hearts. Those
who do not believe in God have made him a liar by not believing in the
testimony that God has given concerning his Son. And this is the
testimony: God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does
not have life. I write these things to you who believe in the name of
the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life.

**GOSPEL John 17.6-19** 'I have made your name known to those whom you
gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and
they have kept your word. Now they know that everything you have given
me is from you; for the words that you gave to me I have given to them,
and they have received them and know in truth that I came from you; and
they have believed that you sent me. I am asking on their behalf; I am
not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those whom you gave
me, because they are yours.All mine are yours, and yours are mine; and I
have been glorified in them. And now I am no longer in the world, but
they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them
in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one, as we are
one. While I was with them, I protected them in your name that you have
given me. I guarded them, and not one of them was lost except the one
destined to be lost, so that the scripture might be fulfilled. But now I
am coming to you, and I speak these things in the world so that they may
have my joy made complete in themselves. I have given them your word,
and the world has hated them because they do not belong to the world,
just as I do not belong to the world. I am not asking you to take them
out of the world, but I ask you to protect them from the evil one. They
do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth. As you have sent me into
the world, so I have sent them into the world. And for their sakes I
sanctify myself, so that they also may be sanctified in truth.
