St Michael’s School Christmas Fayre – at the Junior School, Friday 28th November 4pm-6pm. You would be
welcome to attend. If you do go, no harm in letting them know you are from the church – it helps our St Michael’s
School know that we care and want to support them.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for lasting peace and justice in the world, especially thinking of Ukraine, the
Middle East, and Sudan. We pray for the leaders of the nations that they would seek justice and peace for all people.
We pray for the forthcoming Budget, for wise discernment and action, for the provision of the essential services that
we all rely on; for productive and rewarding employment especially for our young people, and for the protection of the
poor and vulnerable. At the close of the COP conference we pray for the stewardship of creation and protection of the
environment for the benefit of our children and future generations. In our Church life, we pray for our Christmas
Fayre, for all the preparations, and for the day itself, that many from our wider community and friends will come and
have an enjoyable time. We pray for our St Michael’s Schools – for teachers and staff, for the pupils, and for their
parents and guardians.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran,
David Green, Norman Farrington, Chris Jenkins, Bridget Humphries, Bob Humphries and Steve Woolnaugh.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Peter France, Kathleen Stewart-Smith, Evelyn
Leeson, Michael Smith, Charles Parry, Joan White, Barbara Chare, Geoffrey Stevens, Vi Middleton.
