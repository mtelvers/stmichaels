**A very warm welcome** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special welcome-back and thanks to Fr Paul
Matthias, our celebrant this morning, who will also kindly be saying
Mass for us on **Thursday at 10.30 am.** If you are new to St
Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we
can welcome you properly.

**Epiphany Chalk?** At today\'s Mass, according to ancient custom, chalk
will be blessed and all are invited to take a piece home to mark their
door or lintel with the initials of the traditional names of the three
wise men. (Pick up in the narthex a piece of paper explaining how this
is done). A *Church Times* article some years ago commented,"**This
Epiphany ceremony is a simple but meaningful act of witness which
symbolises Christian willingness to offer hospitality and shelter to the
Magi on their journey to Bethlehem, and also, by extension in today's
world, to welcome all and sundry who love or are seeking the Lord's
Christ.**"

**Don\'t forget our Service of Music and Readings for Epiphany,** with
an augmented choir directed by Gareth James, which takes place at 5 pm
today and will be followed by seasonal refreshments in the Vestry Hall.
Could **you** invite a friend or family member who doesn\'t yet know St
Michael\'s? Everyone is welcome, and this is the kind of service -- with
some relaxed socialising - at which visitors sometimes like to "test the
water"!

**Valerie Stickland\'s funeral** will take place at Vinters Park on
31st January at 1.15 pm. Further details shortly.

**Pilgrimage to Walsingham, August 19th-24th.** Some enquiries
already received, but there must surely be more to come. Walsingham just
after August 15th is a beautiful, quiet, prayerful place in which to
spend time with God and with our Lady (whose example of loving obedience
continually points us towards Him) while enjoying the lovely countryside
and coast of north Norfolk. If you have never made a Walsingham
pilgrimage before and want to know more, do speak to Fr Paul or to
Eleanor. An enquiry at this stage doesn\'t commit you -- it\'s just
helpful to Fr Peter Harnden, who is arranging and leading the
pilgrimage, if he can have a rough idea of possible numbers when he
makes a preliminary booking later this month.

**The Parochial Church Council meets on 10th January in the Vestry
Hall at 7.30 pm.** If there is any matter you would like raised, please
speak to a PCC member **today.**

**Worship.Works** has arranged an Ignite! Meet-up at Maidstone House
Level 3, on Thursday 11th January, 6 -7.30 pm. A chance for Christian
professionals to meet one another and explore Biblical principles for
serving God through their work. Tickets (Â£3 per person) are available
via Eventbrite.

Half-muffled for the repose of the souls of the faithful departed during
the last year.

**Can someone very kindly take charge of washing and ironing the altar
linen** (corporals, lavabo towels and purificators)? We are most
grateful to Katja, who has done this in the recent past but is now
unable to continue. We can arrange to deliver and collect if transport
poses a problem. Please speak to Jonathan if you think you may be able
to help.

**Thy Kingdom Come** is an international and ecumenical movement
praying for the spread of the Good News among those who have not yet
heard it. In particular, there will be a Wave of Prayer in May 2024
between Ascension and Pentecost. Visit the website for more
information.
