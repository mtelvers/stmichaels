ST MICHAEL’S ORGAN RECITAL: We have a fantastic “Father Willis” organ, and a young recitalist Levante Vas
(of Maidstone and Oxford) will be providing an Organ Recital for us on Saturday 9th August at 2.30pm followed by
Afternoon Tea and Cakes. Collection for our organ fund, to maintain the organ in tip-top condition. Do please
spread the word around any of your friends and neighbours who might support this, and aim to come yourself
too. I hope this will be the first of many such events (we also have a recital planned as part of Heritage Weekeend).

NEXT SUNDAY AFTERNOON 27th July is the FiF BBQ, Solemn Evensong and Benediction, Harbledown.
Please come if you can for what is always a most enjoyable afternoon. Details at Back of Church, and a sign-up list
so we can let them know how many to cater for.

The annual Deanery Roadshow is at St Luke’s on Thursday evening this week, 6.45 for 7pm; Bishop Rose and
others from the diocesan team will be present to talk about church growth, children and young people’s ministry, and
diocesan finance. Anyone from our PCC or congregation is welcome to attend.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for Harlow Jean Rose, her parents and godparents, as we welcome her for baptism.
We pray for her growth in faith, that she would come to know the Lord Jesus for herself, come to Confirmation, and
take part in the life of the church community here at St Michael’s. We pray for our schools, especially St Michaels
Primary and Juniors, at the end of another school year; that the children will have a safe and happy summer break, that
staff will find refreshment, and that pupils changing schools will look forward to their new school and settle well.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Annemarie Ward, Ellen Breed, Mary
Dalladay, Warner Kim Hall.
