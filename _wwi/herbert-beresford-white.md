and now of 7, Windelsham Gardens, Hove, Sussex. Herbert Beresford White, known as 
Beresford lived at The Poplars with his parents Herbert and Beatrice and his younger 
brother Hugh and sister Beatrice. Beresford White was a Lieutenant in the Royal Field 
Artillery. He was killed in action on 13th April 1917, aged 21. The May 1917 Parish 
magazinetellsus: ‘It was with the deepest and most heartfelt regret that we heard last 
week of the death of our brave young friend, Lieut H. B. White, who has been accidentally 
killed in France by the kick of a horse. The whole parish, we feel sure, will join with us in 
tendering our sincerest sympathy to Mr and Mrs White in this their great and sudden 
bereavement. We know how good and dutiful a son he was, and most of us will remember 
how last autumn, at our open-air services in preparation for the National Mission, he carried
the Union Jack in our procession to Milton Street and elsewhere… he did ‘his bit’ for the old
Church at home, just as since in the great battle of Arras he did ‘his bit’ for King and 
country…thebrigadiergeneral has written about him: - ‘He was a most promising officer, 
and one of the best subalterns under me. He came out here last year and has done 
wonderful work ever since. He was very good and brave with his Battery in the line, and
managed his men so well… He was proud of their work, and they were fond of him.’ His 
Lieutenant-Colonel described him as ‘gallant’, ‘a very popular officer, very keen on his work.’
