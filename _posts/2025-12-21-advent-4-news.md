Regular Giving Envelopes. For those who give weekly through the envelope scheme, your 2026 pack of
envelopes are at the back of church. If you give in this way but your envelopes aren’t there, please contact
me. Likewise, if you would like to give regularly to the upkeep and work of St Michael’s Church via a
weekly envelope then just ask. It does help us to plan, and to reclaim gift aid tax. Fr John.

ADVANCE NOTICE: ORGAN RECITAL in church, Saturday 3rd January 4pm, recitalist Levente Vas.
Begin the New Year with some glorious music played on our wonderful “Father Willis” organ !!

FOR OUR PRAYERS: For peace and justice in the Holy Land. For grace, love and understanding between different
Christian traditions and denominations. For those keeping Christmas in places where they risk persecution for their
Christian faith. For those who will be apart from their loved ones this Christmas, and those in hospital, care homes or
prison this Christmas. For families under stress, for relationships in difficulty, and those suffering from domestic
abuse. For those mourning the loss of a loved one this Christmas. For the homeless, for those who have lost hope, and
for those who cannot see the wonder of the Christmas message of love and forgiveness.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran,
David Green, Norman Farrington, Jacqui Barlow and Joe.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Carol Crisp, David Farrington, Margaret
Amphlett, Winifred Johnes.
