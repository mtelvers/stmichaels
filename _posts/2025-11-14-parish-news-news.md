Do please join us after Mass for Tea, Coffee and Cake in the Vestry Hall - - just ask if you don’t know the way!

SERVICES THIS WEEK: Thursday Mass at 10.30am; Sunday Sung Mass with baptisms 10.30am All services
followed by tea, coffee and cake.

There will be a short meeting in the Vestry Hall after Mass for those interested in planning for our 150th
Anniversary Year in 2026.

ST MICHAEL’S SCOUTS GROUPS. We have Squirrels (age 4-6) Beavers (6-8), cubs (8-10) and Scouts (10-14)
who all meet in our church halls. THE GROUPS ARE LOOKING FOR MORE LEADERS SO THEY CAN
CONTINUE AFTER CHRISTMAS. Is this something you, or someone you know, could help with? If so, do
please let me know asap.

Church Safeguarding. The CofE urges us to use this Sunday as an opportunity each year to pray for the important
safeguarding work of our church, and to give thanks for those who work in parish and diocese to keep all children and
vulnerable adults safe. If you ever have any safeguarding concerns, do not hesitate to contact myself, or the Parish
Safeguarding Officer or the diocesan safeguarding team whose details can be found on the church noticeboards.

CHRISTMAS FAYRE 29TH November: There are boxes near the entrance to the Ascension Chapel ready to
receive donations for the various stalls, raffle and tombola. Do please be generous.

There will be a GARDEN WORKING PARTY next Saturday 22nd November from 12 noon, to tidy the grounds
of the church ready for the Christmas Fayre. Do please give half an hour (or more) of your time to this if you
can. Questions to Zoe.

NOVEMBER is a time of remembrance, with All Saints, All Souls and Remembrance Sunday. So it is time for my
annual reminder of the need to ensure you have made preparations for your own death, including keeping your Will up
to date, ensuring your affairs are in order, considering a Lasting Power of Attorney to cope with increasing frailty –
and setting out your funeral wishes. By planning for a proper Christian Funeral, you can witness to all those who
attend the funeral to the faith that has accompanied you throughout your life, and to the hope and trust that you have in
Jesus Christ. And for those who already share this faith, it gives them the opportunity to celebrate at your death that
faith which they have shared with you in life.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for our Scouts and Guides groups, giving thanks for the work they do with our
young people, and we pray for the dedicated helpers we need to maintain this valuable service to our community. We
pray for our ministry of welcome to all those who visit our church, and pray that this will continue to be a safe
community offering welfare and support to all who come. We pray for our Christmas Fayre, for all the preparations,
and for the day itself, that many from our wider community and friends will come and have an enjoyable time.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, David Green, Norman Farrington, Chris Jenkins, Bridget Humphries, Bob Humphries and Steve
Woolnaugh.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Irene Place, Connie Bridge, Tony Read,
Monica Wakelin, Judith Brown, David William O’Sullivan.
