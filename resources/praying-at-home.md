There is a new phone resource called _Daily Hope_. When you phone it, you hear a message from the Archbishop, and can then opt to:

*   listen to a well-known hymn and a talk about it (option 1);
*   listen to hymns on a loop (option 2);
*   Listen to prayers being read (option 3).

This could be helpful for people isolated at home and is completely free of charge.
