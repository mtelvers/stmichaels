# COLLECT

Almighty God, who alone can bring order to the unruly wills and passions
of sinful humanity:

give your people grace so to love what you command and to desire what
you promise, that, among the many changes of this world, our hearts may
surely there be fixed where true joys are to be found;

through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with
you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Jeremiah 17: 5-10)

## A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.

Thus says the Lord:\
Cursed are those who trust in mere mortals and make mere flesh their
strength, whose hearts turn away from the Lord.\
They shall be like a shrub in the desert, and shall not see when relief
comes. They shall live in the parched places of the wilderness, in an
uninhabited salt land.\
Blessed are those who trust in the Lord, whose trust is the Lord. They
shall be like a tree planted by water, sending out its roots by
the stream. It shall not fear when heat comes, and its leaves shall stay
green; in the year of drought it is not anxious, and it does not cease
to bear fruit.\
The heart is devious above all else; it is perverse - who can understand
it?\
I the Lord test the mind and search the heart, to give to all according
to their ways, according to the fruit of their doings.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 1) 

## Response: Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord.

**1.** Blessed indeed is the man\
who follows not the counsel of the wicked,\
nor takes the path of sinners.\
Whose delight is the law of the Lord,\
and who meditates on his law, day and night. ***R.***

**2.** He is like a tree that is planted\
beside the flowing waters,\
that yields its fruit in due season\
and whose leaves shall never fade.\
All that he does shall prosper.\
but the way of the wicked shall perish. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (1 Cor 15: 12-20)

## A reading from the first letter of Paul to the Corinthians.

Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you
say there is no resurrection of the dead? If there is no resurrection of
the dead, then Christ has not been raised; and if Christ has not been
raised, then our proclamation has been in vain and your faith has been
in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we
testified of God that he raised Christ---whom he did not raise if it is
true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, then
Christ has not been raised. If Christ has not been raised, your faith is
futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have died in
Christ have perished. If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we
are of all people most to be pitied.

But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of
those who have died.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 6: 17-26) 

Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place, with a great crowd
of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all Judea,
Jerusalem, and the coast of Tyre and Sidon. They had come to hear him
and to be healed of their diseases; and those who were troubled with
unclean spirits were cured. And all in the crowd were trying to touch
him, for power came out from him and healed all of them.

Then he looked up at his disciples and said: 'Blessed are you who are
poor, for yours is the kingdom of God.\
'Blessed are you who are hungry now, for you will be filled.\
'Blessed are you who weep now, for you will laugh.

'Blessed are you when people hate you, and when they exclude you, revile
you, and defame you on account of the Son of Man. Rejoice on that day
and leap for joy, for surely your reward is great in heaven; for that is
what their ancestors did to the prophets.\
'But woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation.\
'Woe to you who are full now, for you will be hungry.\
'Woe to you who are laughing now, for you will mourn and weep.

'Woe to you when all speak well of you, for that is what their ancestors
did to the false prophets.
