The Rosary is a devotion that has shown its worth for eight centuries. This leaflet will help you start using it. You can buy a set of rosary beads from Amazon; there is a price to suit almost anyone. You can also use your fingers to count the Hail Marys. Once you’re used to it, you get caught up in the meditation and the prayers form a kind of backdrop — hence the beads or fingers to keep you on track with the minimum of distraction. You can buy books of rosary devotion or download helpful materials. There are versions for children, too and even rosary apps for tablets and smartphones.
