# COLLECT

Heavenly Father, by the power of your Holy Spirit you give
your faithful people new life in the water of baptism. Guide and
strengthen us by the same Spirit, that we who are born again may serve
you in faith and love, and grow into the full stature of your Son, Jesus
Christ, who is alive and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy
Spirit, now and for ever, Amen.

# FIRST READING (Exodus 34: 29-end)

## A reading from the book of Exodus.

Moses came down from Mount Sinai. As he came down from the mountain with
the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the
skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God. When Aaron
and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and
they were afraid to come near him. But Moses called to them; and Aaron
and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and Moses spoke
with them. Afterwards all the Israelites came near, and he gave them in
commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him on Mount Sinai. When
Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil on his face; but
whenever Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he would take
the veil off, until he came out; and when he came out, and told the
Israelites what he had been commanded, the Israelites would see the face
of Moses, that the skin of his face was shining; and Moses would put the
veil on his face again, until he went in to speak with him.

# RESPONSORIAL READING (From Isaiah 43)

##Â Response: I will make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

1\. I am the Lord, your Holy One,\
the Creator of Israel, your king.\
Thus says the Lord who makes a way in the sea\
a path in the mighty waters. ***R.***

2\. Remember not the former things\
nor consider the things of old.\
Behold I am doing a new thing\
now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? ***R.***

3\. I will make a way in the wilderness\
and rivers in the desert,\
to give drink to my chosen people,\
the people who I formed for myself\
that they might declare my praise. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (2 Corinthians 3: 12-end)

## A reading from the second letter of Paul to the Corinthians.

Since, then, we have such a hope, we act with great boldness, not like
Moses, who put a veil over his face to keep the people of Israel from
gazing at the end of the glory that was being set aside. But their minds
were hardened. Indeed, to this very day, when they hear the reading of
the old covenant, that same veil is still there, since only in Christ is
it set aside. Indeed, to this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil
lies over their minds; but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is
removed. Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord
is, there is freedom. And all of us, with unveiled faces, seeing the
glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror, are being transformed
into the same image from one degree of glory to another; for this comes
from the Lord, the Spirit.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 9: 28-36)

Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the
mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face
changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two
men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were
speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at
Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep;
but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who
stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus,
'Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one
for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah'---not knowing what he
said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and
they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came
a voice that said, 'This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!' When the
voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in
those days told no one any of the things they had seen.
