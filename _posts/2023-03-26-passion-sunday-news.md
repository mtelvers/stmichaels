A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to
St Michael\'s. A special welcome to Fr Paul, our celebrant this morning,
who will also kindly be celebrating Mass for us on Thursday at 10.30 am.
If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us for tea or coffee in the
Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can welcome you properly.

**Our Annual Parochial Church Meeting** is on Sunday 30th April after
Mass. In preparation for it, we have to update the church **Electoral
Roll.** If you have joined or rejoined St Michael\'s during the past
year, and would like to be on the Roll, please speak to Martyn and fill
in a form (at back of church). Please also see Martyn If you wish to
update your details, or check that they are correct.

**Join Bishop Norman for the Chrism Mass in Canterbury Cathedral** on
Tuesday, 4th April, at 12 noon. Could you offer a lift to someone?
(Eleanor has 3 places in her car). Bishop Norman, always a good friend
to St Michael\'s, retires later this year. He will celebrate Mass in
Canterbury Cathedral for the last time on June 10th and his last
Richborough Family Festival in St Albans will be on August 5th. More
details later, but put the dates in your diary!

**More Dates -- agreed at the last PCC Meeting:** Our **Coronation Big
Lunch** will be a bring-and-share lunch after Mass on **Sunday, May
7th**. And we look forward to our **Strawberry Fair** on **Saturday,
July 1st** -- please contact Sara with fair ideas and offers of help.

**Thanks to Fr Derek** for so kindly leading our Quiet Day in the
beautiful surroundings of The Friars.
