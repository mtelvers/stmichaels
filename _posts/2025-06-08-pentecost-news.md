A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
A very big thank you to all who contributed to our Confirmation Mass last Sunday – for the choir, those who
welcomed people into our Church, for those who tidied the church and grounds beforehand, and for those who
prepared and served a glorious lunch, and washed up afterwards. It was a wonderful occasion, and Bishop Luke sends
his thanks to all.

Our Lady of Walsingham: Eight pilgrims enjoyed a fantastic and uplifting pilgrimage to Walsingham earlier this
month. They returned with a new Statue of Our Lady of Walsingham, which was blessed by Bishop Luke at Mass last
Sunday and is now installed by our Lady Altar. It is absolutely beautiful. Do make time to visit and contemplate this
statue of Mary leading us to her Son Jesus, pray for the Shrine of Walsingham, and pray for Mary’s blessing on our
work of mission and ministry here at St Michaels. We have a Cell of Our Lady of Walsingham which meets for Mass
once a month and whose members promise to pray daily to Mary. If you want to know more or to join the Cell, just
ask.

Summer Fete: A reminder that this is on Saturday 5th July. Alison will be holding a meeting in the Vestry Hall after
Mass this Sunday for all involved.

Corpus Christi Flower Festival at St John’s Higham: 19th-22nd June 9am-6pm, admission free. Notice at Back of

Folkestone Blessing of the Fisheries with Bishop Luke: Sunday 29th June. Notice at Back of Church.

FOR OUR PRAYERS:

For a fresh outpouring of God’s Holy Spirit in the Church, and for renewal in the Church and vision and energy in
mission and ministry. For Pope Leo XIV; for our Bishop Luke and for all parishes and clergy under his care. For our
life, ministry and mission here at St Michaels.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington, and Fr Derek Mottershead.

We pray for the recently departed, including Paul Mounsey and Trevor Joseph. We remember those who have
faithfully served God in this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this
week: Rod Bristow.
