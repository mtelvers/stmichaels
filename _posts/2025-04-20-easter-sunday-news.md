## Priest-in-Charge Fr John Ainslie ([revjohnainslie@gmail.com](mailto:revjohnainslie@gmail.com); 01628 629827)

**A very warm welcome** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service so we can welcome
you properly.

**SERVICES THIS COMING WEEK:** Thursday: Mass at 10.30am. Next Sunday:
Sung Mass at 10.30am followed by APCM.

**THE FUNERAL OF JOHN MERCER** is on Wednesday this week at 11am in
church.

**LENT BOXES:** If you weren't at church on Maundy Thursday and still
have a Lent Box can you please return that to me asap. Thanks. Fr John.

**ANNUAL CHURCH MEETINGS:** The Meeting to elect Churchwardens, and the
APCM to receive accounts and reports from the PCC and to elect members
of the new PCC, both take place immediately after Mass next Sunday. You
are warmly encouraged to attend this important meeting in the life of
our Church family, which will not take long.

**New members on the PCC would be especially welcome** as the current
PCC has struggled to get to grips with its responsibilities for
buildings, maintenance and anything financial. PCC members don't need to
do everything themselves, but they do have a collective responsibility
to make sure that things are being done, and done well, so an interest
in these areas would be helpful.

**If you think you could support the work of St Michael's Church in this
way,** please speak to me. Nomination Forms for Churchwarden, PCC and
Deanery Synod are available at Back of Church.

**FOR OUR PRAYERS:** We pray that the Peace of the Risen Christ will
reign in our world, our Nation, our Community, our Church and in our
hearts. That the message of the glorious Gospel of the Resurrection
would reach to the ends of the earth, and dwell in the hearts of people
everywhere.

**We pray for those in need**, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis
Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn
Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington.

**We pray for the recently departed**. We remember those who have
faithfully served God in this Church in previous generations, and we
pray for those whose year's mind occurs this week: Harry Mills, Mary
Taylor, Kathleen Clifford, Isabel Brooks.
