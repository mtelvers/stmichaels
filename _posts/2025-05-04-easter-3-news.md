A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
SERVICES THIS COMING WEEK: Thursday: Mass at 10.30am. Next Sunday: Sung Mass at 10.30am.

CONGRATULATIONS to Jonathan Ardley and Zoe Lee, both elected as Churchwardens for the coming year, and to
those who will be serving on the PCC this year. We thank them for offering their time and talents to serve our Church
here at St Michaels in this way.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: Thanksgiving for the end to hostilities in Europe 80 years ago this week. For freedom from
conflict and oppression in our own time, and especially for the people of Gaza and agencies who seek to bring to the
innocent relief from suffering. For Jonathan and Zoe and members of the PCC. For our candidates to be confirmed on
1st June. For the Cardinals of the RC Church as they meet in Rome to elect a new Pontiff.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Mary Flisher, Margaret Kent, Ellen Tame
