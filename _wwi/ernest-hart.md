Son of Mr Stephen Alfred Hart and Mrs Mary Elizabeth Hart of 55, Milton Street 
MAIDSTONE, KENT. In the 1901 Census the family lived at 61 Milton Street, Maidstone, 
when Ernest was 10. Ernest and his brother Albert attended St Peter’s & St Michael’s Boys
School. From 1905 – 1909 Ernest was a pupil at Maidstone Grammar School. Ernest and 
his brother Albert were both pupil teachers at the school under headmaster A. Adams and 
the Rev J.H. Best. They then attended St Mark’s College in London to train as teachers.

‘Ernst Hart, one of the most promising young men, and who used to be a member of our 
Milton Street (Mission Church) Choir has been killed in action at the front. One of his 
companionswrites: ‘As my Platoon Commander he did his duty manfully and led us over 
the parapet of our trench in the attack, which we made on the German line. He had hardly 
got through our barbed wire entanglements when several of the lads were hit, Ernest being
among them. His last words were, ‘Come on lads.’ His death was almost instantaneous. 
Those that are left of us miss him very much, as he was one we could rely
on, and a great favourite among his men. I’d give anything to have him back again as we 
have been together through thick and thin right from the time we enlisted and a better 
chum no man could ever want.’’
