# FIRST READING (Ezekiel 2: 1-5)

The Lord said to me: O mortal, stand up on your feet, and I will speak
with you. And when he spoke to me, a spirit entered into me and set me
on my feet; and I heard him speaking to me. He said to me, Mortal, I am
sending you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels who have
rebelled against me; they and their ancestors have transgressed against
me to this very day. The descendants are impudent and stubborn. I am
sending you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the
Lord God.' Whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a
rebellious house), they shall know that there has been a prophet among
them.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (Ps 123)

Response: Our eyes are on the Lord as we look for his mercy.

1\.  To you I lift up my eyes,\
you who dwell in the heavens:\
as the eyes of servants so our eyes\
look to the hand of their master. R.

2\. Like the eyes of a maidservant\
on the hand of her mistress,\
look to the Lord our God\
until he has mercy on us.  R.

3\. Have mercy on us, Lord, have mercy.\
We have had enough of contempt.\
Our soul has endured too much\
of the scorn of the rich,\
and the disdain of the proud. R.

# SECOND READING (2 Corinthians 12: 2-10)

I know a person in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the
third heaven---whether in the body or out of the body I do not know; God
knows. And I know that such a person---whether in the body or out of the
body I do not know; God knows--- was caught up into Paradise and heard
things that are not to be told, that no mortal is permitted to
repeat. On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on my own behalf I
will not boast, except of my weaknesses. But if I wish to boast, I will
not be a fool, for I will be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it,
so that no one may think better of me than what is seen in me or heard
from me, even considering the exceptional character of the revelations.
Therefore, to keep me from being too elated, a thorn was given to me in
the flesh, a messenger of Satan to torment me, to keep me from being too
elated. Three times I appealed to the Lord about this, that it would
leave me, but he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for
power is made perfect in weakness.' So, I will boast all the more gladly
of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore
I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and
calamities for the sake of Christ; for whenever I am weak, then I am
strong.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Mark 6: 1-13)

Jesus came to his home town, and his disciples followed him. On the
sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were
astounded. They said, 'Where did this man get all this? What is this
wisdom that has been given to him? What deeds of power are being done by
his hands! Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of
James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with
us?' And they took offence at him. Then Jesus said to them, 'Prophets
are not without honour, except in their home town, and among their own
kin, and in their own house.' And he could do no deed of power there,
except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and cured them. And
he was amazed at their unbelief.

Then he went about among the villages teaching. He called the twelve and
began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the
unclean spirits. He ordered them to take nothing for their journey
except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts; but to wear
sandals and not to put on two tunics. He said to them, 'Wherever you
enter a house, stay there until you leave the place. If any place will
not welcome you and they refuse to hear you, as you leave, shake off the
dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them.' So they went out
and proclaimed that all should repent. They cast out many demons, and
anointed with oil many who were sick and cured them.
