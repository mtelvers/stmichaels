**HARVEST THANKSGIVING Hymns 261, 259, 397, 262**

**FIRST READING Deuteronomy 8.7-18** For the Lord your God is bringing
you into a good land, a land with flowing streams, with springs and
underground waters welling up in valleys and hills, a land of wheat and
barley, of vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive trees
and honey, a land where you may eat bread without scarcity, where you
will lack nothing, a land whose stones are iron and from whose hills you
may mine copper. You shall eat your fill and bless the Lord your God for
the good land that he has given you. Take care that you do not forget
the Lord your God, by failing to keep his commandments, his ordinances,
and his statutes, which I am commanding you today. When you have eaten
your fill and have built fine houses and live in them, and when your
herds and flocks have multiplied, and your silver and gold is
multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied, then do not exalt
yourself, forgetting the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land
of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, who led you through the great and
terrible wilderness, an arid waste-land with poisonous snakes and
scorpions. He made water flow for you from flint rock, and fed you in
the wilderness with manna that your ancestors did not know, to humble
you and to test you, and in the end to do you good. Do not say to
yourself, 'My power and the might of my own hand have gained me this
wealth.' But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you
power to get wealth, so that he may confirm his covenant that he swore
to your ancestors, as he is doing today.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 65 *Response: Be joyful in God, all the earth.***

**The ends of the earth stand in awe** at the sight of your wonders.

The lands of sunrise and sunset you fill with your joy. ***R***

 You care for the earth, give it water; you fill it with riches.

Your river in heaven brims over to provide its grain. ***R***

 And thus you provide for the earth; you drench its furrows;

you level it, soften it with showers; you bless its growth. ***R***

 You crown the year with your goodness. Abundance flows in your steps;

in the pastures of the wilderness it flows. ***R***

 The hills are girded with joy, the meadows covered with flocks,

the valleys are decked with wheat; they shout for joy, yes they sing.
***R***

**SECOND READING 2Corinthians 9.6-15** The point is this: the one who
sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows
bountifully will also reap bountifully. Each of you must give as you
have made up your mind, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God
loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to provide you with every
blessing in abundance, so that by always having enough of everything,
you may share abundantly in every good work. As it is written,\
'He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor; his righteousness endures for
ever.'\
He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and
multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your
righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for your great
generosity, which will produce thanksgiving to God through us; for the
rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but
also overflows with many thanksgivings to God. Through the testing of
this ministry you glorify God by your obedience to the confession of the
gospel of Christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and
with all others, while they long for you and pray for you because of the
surpassing grace of God that he has given you. Thanks be to God for his
indescribable gift!

**GOSPEL Luke 12.16-30** Then he told them a parable: 'The land of a
rich man produced abundantly. And he thought to himself, "What should I
do, for I have no place to store my crops?" Then he said, "I will do
this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will
store all my grain and my goods. And I will say to my soul, Soul, you
have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry."
But God said to him, "You fool! This very night your life is being
demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?"
So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not
rich towards God.' He said to his disciples, 'Therefore I tell you, do
not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what
you will wear. For life is more than food, and the body more than
clothing. Consider the ravens: they neither sow nor reap, they have
neither storehouse nor barn, and yet God feeds them. Of how much more
value are you than the birds! And can any of you by worrying add a
single hour to your span of life? If then you are not able to do so
small a thing as that, why do you worry about the rest? Consider the
lilies, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; yet I tell you, even
Solomon in all his glory was not clothed like one of these. But if God
so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is
thrown into the oven, how much more will he clothe you---you of little
faith! And do not keep striving for what you are to eat and what you are
to drink, and do not keep worrying. For it is the nations of the world
that strive after all these things, and your Father knows that you need
them.\'
