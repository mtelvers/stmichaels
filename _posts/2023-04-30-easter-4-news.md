*A very warm welcome* to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul, our celebrant
this morning, who will also kindly be saying Mass for us on Thursday at
10.30 am. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall
after the service, so that we can welcome you properly. Today we hold
our Annual Parish Church Meeting, to which all are invited. Many thanks
to Paul, who has generously provided sparkling wine and nibbles to make
the occasion still more enjoyable.

**Emerge** is a local Christian charity devoted to befriending young
people who have been self-harming or attempting suicide. The number of
these in this part of Kent runs into hundreds every year, the vast
majority of them teenage girls. Emerge seeks to train volunteers to
support such young people, in crisis or recovery, whether in hospital or
in the community. It also seeks prayers and donations. For information,
please email <info@emergeadvocacy.com>.

**Having a clear-out?** Make a Difference Maidstone (MADM) seeks items
of furniture that could be repaired or upcycled, for sale in its shop or
for people who have no furniture. Other household items are likely to be
welcome also. Kent County Council is supporting this initiative to save
usable items from being dumped. Enquiries, please, to 01622 687414.

**Can you help a neighbour parish?** The new St Faith\'s Community
Centre is almost completed, but as it approaches the last lap it has
been offered a crowdfunding page by Aviva. Any gift of less than Â£250
(per household) will be matched by Aviva if it arrives before May
26th. The crowdfunding link is
