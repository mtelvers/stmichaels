   There is no service on Thursday this week, as there will be the Funeral Requiem of Paul Jones at Yalding.



THIS SUNDAY there will be a collection of dried and tinned foods and toiletries for Maidstone Homeless Care.
Please place your offering in the basket, which will be brought forward and blessed during Mass this morning.


THE REQUIEM FUNERAL MASS OF PAUL JONES will take place at St Peter's and St Paul's Church, Yalding,
Maidstone, ME18 6HU, on Thursday 28th August at 10.30am and afterwards at The Chequers Inn, The Street,
Laddingford, Maidstone, ME18 6BP. All Paul’s friends from St Michael’s are warmly encouraged to attend the
Funeral, or the Wake, or both. The family have asked that you let them know (at [pius.gallagher@sky.com](mailto:pius.gallagher@sky.com)) if you will
be attending so they can judge numbers.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: For peace in Gaza and the Middle east; and in the Ukraine. For all refugees and asylum
seekers, and for Governments that they may seek compassionate and just solutions to the refugee crisis. For the
Church of England, that it may stand four-square on the faith handed down from the Apostles, and for Bishop Luke
and all clergy and parishes under his care; for the Churches proclamation of the Gospel in word and in deed. For the
well-being of all who live or work in our Parish.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed, especially Paul Jones. We remember those who have faithfully served God in
this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Paul Gibbons (Pr),
Emily Aldous.
