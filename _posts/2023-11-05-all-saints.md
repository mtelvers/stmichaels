**ALL SAINTS\' DAY (transferred) Hymns: 231, 197, 277, 396**

**FIRST READING Revelation 7.9-17** After this I looked, and there was a
great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, from all
tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before
the Lamb, robed in white, with palm branches in their hands. They cried
out in a loud voice, saying, 'Salvation belongs to our God who is seated
on the throne, and to the Lamb!' And all the angels stood around the
throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they
fell on their faces before the throne and worshipped God, singing,
'Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and
power and might be to our God for ever and ever! Amen.' Then one of the
elders addressed me, saying, 'Who are these, robed in white, and where
have they come from?' I said to him, 'Sir, you are the one that knows.'
Then he said to me, 'These are they who have come out of the great
ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of
the Lamb. For this reason they are before the throne of God, and worship
him day and night within his temple, and the one who is seated on the
throne will shelter them. They will hunger no more, and thirst no more;
the sun will not strike them, nor any scorching heat; for the Lamb at
the centre of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them
to springs of the water of life, and God will wipe away every tear from
their eyes.'

**SECOND READING 1 John 3.1-3** See what love the Father has given us,
that we should be called children of God; and that is what we are. The
reason the world does not know us is that it did not know him. Beloved,
we are God's children now; what we will be has not yet been revealed.
What we do know is this: when he is revealed, we will be like him, for
we will see him as he is. And all who have this hope in him purify
themselves, just as he is pure.

**GOSPEL Matthew 5.1-12** When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up the
mountain; and after he sat down, his disciples came to him. Then he
began to speak, and taught them, saying:

'Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

'Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.

'Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.

'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they
will be filled.

'Blessed are the merciful, for they will receive mercy.

'Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.

'Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.

'Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for
theirs is the kingdom of heaven. 'Blessed are you when people revile you
and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my
account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in
the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.\'
