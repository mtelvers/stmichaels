**News From St Michael\'s, Advent Sunday 2022**

***A warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s, as we keep this first Sunday of the Church\'s year --
Advent Sunday. Advent is a season in its own right - a time of
expectation and hope, with its own opportunities and challenges:

"Yea, let us each our hearts prepare

For Christ to come and enter there."

A special welcome to our celebrant Fr Paul, who will also kindly
celebrate Mass for us on Thursday at 10.30 am. If you are new to St
Michael\'s, please join us for tea or coffee in the Vestry Hall after
Mass, so that we can welcome you properly.

**James Taylor writes:** "Thank you all so very much for the cards, your
prayers and your very kind and loving words. We are so grateful to you
all." We continue to pray for his granny-in-law Francesca and for all
the family.

**Vacancy News:** Fr Richard Bolton, formerly of Holy Trinity, Winchmore
Hill, has applied to become our parish priest and will be coming to
Maidstone for interview on December 7th. The timetable for the day has
yet to be announced from the Archdeacon\'s office, but it will certainly
include an opportunity for parishioners to meet him, and for him to meet
parishioners. Alas, the 7th is a working day -- but please watch this
space and see if you might be available when it matters. Everyone needs
to feel that the "fit" is right! And please keep Fr Richard, the
appointment process, and all concerned in it, in your prayers.

**The Mothers\' Union Advent service,** planned for the 7th, will now
take place on the 14th.

**Our Coffee Morning (10th December, 10.30 am - 1 pm)** needs
publicity and support from everyone. Spread the word, and see what you
can contribute to make it a success!

**The Garden Working Party** meets on December 3^rd^, 9.30am -- 12 noon.
Warmest thanks to all who give time and energy to make our church look
welcoming, inside and out.

**On our Advent Wreath** (Thank you, Jessica!), we can "light up" the
themes that unfold at the Sunday Masses of Advent -- part of our joyful
and solemn preparation for Christmas. Jessica will be glad of help with
the trees and other decorations on the 14th.

**St Andrew\'s, Deal,** one of our neighbour Resolution parishes,
celebrates its patronal festival on Wednesday 30th with Mass at 7.30
pm. Everyone is invited.

**Our Heating (yes, we now have some!):** Many thanks to Nelly and
Martyn for their efforts in locating our gas man (who had moved), and
being on the spot when he came to service the boiler. Nelly is one of
very many PCC treasurers who have applied for a grant to help their
churches with heating costs. Not surprisingly (despite a horribly
complicated form), there has been a flood of applications, not all of
which will succeed, but the diocese will notify the lucky parishes in
the near future.

**Advent Sunday 2022 Hymns NEH 1, 10, 6, 9**

**FIRST READING Isaiah 2.1-5**

The word that Isaiah son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.

In days to come the mountain of the Lord's house shall be established as
the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; all
the nations shall stream to it. Many peoples shall come and say, 'Come,
let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of
Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.'

For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord
from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate
for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and
their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against
nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the Lord!

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 122**

**Response: I rejoiced when I heard them say: Let us go to God's
house.**

1\. I rejoiced when I heard them say:

"Let us go to God's house."

And now our feet are standing:

within your gates, O Jerusalem. **R.**

2\. Jerusalem is built as a city:

strongly compact.

It is there that the tribes go up;

the tribes of the Lord. **R.**

3\. For the love of my brethren and friends;

I say, "Peace upon you!"

For the love of the house of the Lord:

I will ask for your good. **R.**

**SECOND READING Romans 13.11-14**

Besides this, you know what time it is, how it is now the moment for you
to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we
became believers; the night is far gone, the day is near. Let us then
lay aside the works of darkness and put on the armour of light; let us
live honourably as in the day, not in revelling and drunkenness, not in
debauchery and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy. Instead,
put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to
gratify its desires.

**GOSPEL Matthew 24.36-44**

'But about that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of heaven,
nor the Son, but only the Father. For as the days of Noah were, so will
be the coming of the Son of Man. For as in those days before the flood
they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until
the day Noah entered the ark, and they knew nothing until the flood came
and swept them all away, so too will be the coming of the Son of Man.
Then two will be in the field; one will be taken and one will be left.
Two women will be grinding meal together; one will be taken and one will
be left. Keep awake therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord
is coming. But understand this: if the owner of the house had known in
what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake
and would not have let his house be broken into. Therefore you also must
be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour.
