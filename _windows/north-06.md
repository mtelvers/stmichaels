“The angel of the Lord ascended in the flame of the altar.” A stranger has promised Manoah and his childless wife a son, and gives them strict instructions about his upbringing. Manoah sacrifices a kid “upon a rock” and the stranger reveals himself as an angel by mounting heavenward in the flame, as Manoah and his wife kneel in prayer. The promised child will be the hero Samson. (Judges 13).
