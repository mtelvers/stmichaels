A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to
St Michael\'s. A special welcome to Fr Paul, our celebrant this morning,
who will also kindly be celebrating Mass for us on Thursday at 10.30 am.
If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us for tea or coffee in the
Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can welcome you properly.

**Our Coronation Lunch** will take place after Mass on Sunday, May
7th. Do please sign up on the list at the back of church, indicating
what you would like to bring! Alison will welcome any offers of help
before or after. And it isn\'t too early to start having ideas for the
**Strawberry Fair on Saturday, July 1st.** Could you help to publicise
it, or track down any suitable goodies to be sold or raffled? Have a
word with Sara when you can.

**Maidstone Bible Week,** Tuesday 9th -- Friday 12th May. We are among
the Maidstone churches who have been asked to publicise this; details
and flyers can be found at the back of church. This year\'s focus is on
the Book of Daniel.

**Easter Flowers:** Thank you, members of the congregation who gave
lilies in memory of loved ones. You will find their names listed in the
Narthex.

**Orthodox Easter this Sunday!** The PCC has been delighted to welcome
Fr Michael and his Romanian Orthodox congregation to celebrate Easter in
our church building.
