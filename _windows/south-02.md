“Be it unto me according to thy word.” Mary has been praying or meditating on the Scriptures which contain the promises of God – note the open scroll on her prayer-desk and the rolled-up scroll in the left foreground. A potted lily, symbolising her purity, stands beside her. Gabriel, bearing a herald’s wand, brings the message that through the Holy Spirit (seen entering through the window in the form of a dove), Mary is to be the mother of the Saviour. Mary responds in loving obedience as, outside the window, the sun rises over Nazareth (Luke 1).
