thenovember1917 parish magazine wrote in memoriam: ‘Another name must be added to those who have gone to join the ranks of the gallant dead. Fred Busbridge was well-known and deservedly popular, and he had helped the Church as a chorister and ringer for a number of years. This is the second loss that Mr and Mrs Busbridge have sustained in the War, and we pray that they may be given strength to bear their great loss, and that their son’s faithful service to the Church may bring him light refreshment and peace in the new and higher life to which he has been called’.
