***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul
Matthias, our celebrant this morning, who will also kindly be saying
Mass for us on **Thursday at 10.30 am.** Everyone is warmly invited to
coffee in the Vestry Hall after Mass. If new to St Michael\'s, do join
us so that we can welcome you properly!

**Valerie Brown\'s funeral** **Mass** will take place in church on
Friday, 27th October, at 12.30 pm (please note the slight alteration
in timing), followed by cremation at Vinters Park at 2.45 pm. A card
from the St Michael\'s congregation has been sent to her daughter
Catherine.

**Grateful thanks** to all who helped with the bagging-up (last Sunday)
and the loading (last Thursday) of the harvest gifts, and to Sue for her
kindness in driving it all to the Foodbank run by Maidstone Homeless
Care, where the staff were delighted to see us, helped us unload, and
sent a message of thanks to all the contributors. This message has also
been passed on to the St Michael\'s Schools. This Foodbank and Day
Centre helps not only homeless people but "anybody in Maidstone" who is
in urgent need. To find out more, visit homelesscare.org.uk. Donations
of money and imperishable food are always hugely appreciated.

**Many thanks too to Martyn,** who is tackling several maintenance jobs
in the church halls during the Wendy House half-term. Martyn also
directs the Garden Working Party. If you also would like to offer some
of your time and skill to keep our site attractive and welcoming, Martyn
will always be happy to suggest ways in which you can help!

**From Our Tower:** On Monday, 20th November, we shall be welcoming
visitors from Gloucestershire who will be ringing our bells from 7.30 to
8.30 pm.

**Vacancy News:** The Archdeacon has invited the two representatives
chosen by our PCC to attend a shortlisting meeting on October 18th.
Please continue to pray that the Holy Spirit will guide all concerned in
the appointment process.

**Choral Evensong** often speaks not only to active Anglicans but to
many people whose links with the Church are far less definite.
**Everyone will be welcome at Choral Evensong at St Michael\'s at 5 pm
on Sunday, 29th October,** with a gathered choir conducted by Gareth
James. Do pass the word around!

**The Maidstone Deanery Roadshow at St Luke\'s, Maidstone, on *Monday
October 16th* at 7 pm - what is it?** Deanery Roadshows are a chance
for parishes to learn about the financial plans of the diocese and how
they will affect the deanery and its parishes. Those present can ask
questions and, indeed, make representations about financial matters that
concern them. Recently St Michael\'s has made its presence felt, and its
voice heard, on these occasions. Please try to come along.

**Flowers in church:** Members of the congregation sometimes wish to
dedicate a flower arrangement in church in memory of a loved one. If you
would like to do this, please have a word with Margaret G., who can
provide information and help.

**The Parochial Church Council meets on November 8th at 7.30 pm.** If
you have any items you would like included in the agenda, please speak
as soon as possible to Jonathan, Paul, Eleanor or another PCC member.
There is scope for our PCC to include one or two co-opted members; if
you might be willing to contribute ideas, skills or an extra pair of
hands in this way, please speak to Jonathan.

**Our Fair!** Labelled boxes for Tombola prizes and other attractions
will now be found at the back of the church. Please keep a lookout for
suitable items and bring them to church -- and please also contact
**Sara (07837 919761)** with ideas and offers of assistance.

**A prayer for the Holy Land by the Very Reverend Andrew Nunn:**

Lord Jesus,\
who walked the land you made holy\
and blessed those who made peace;\
look with compassion\
on the people of your land today,\
Jew and Muslim and Christian,\
Israeli and Palestinian.\
May peace come for all with justice,\
may war cease and all live in harmony,\
and be the children of the one God\
whom you made known,\
now and always.

Amen.
