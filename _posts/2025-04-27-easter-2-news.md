A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.

10.30am. Next Sunday: Sung Mass at 10.30am. All followed by refreshments.

THURSDAY 3pm: The Wedding Service of Adam Hill and Ruby Brunsdon-Lloyd.

ANNUAL CHURCH MEETINGS: The Meeting to elect Churchwardens, and the APCM to receive accounts and
reports from the PCC and to elect members of the new PCC, both take place immediately after Mass today. Please stay
for this important meeting in the life of our Church family, which will not take long. They will be followed by
refreshments in the Vestry Hall.

The agendas and reports for the meetings have been emailed out, and there are a few paper copies at back of church.

Nomination forms are at Back of Church; nominations will be received up to the meetings themselves, but
nominations must be received on the appropriate form, duly signed.

Thank you. Fr John.




FOR OUR PRAYERS: For peace and joy in this season of Eastertide. For the Cardinals of the RC Church as they
meet in Rome to appoint a new Pontiff. For those who will serve as members of the PCC of St Michaels Maidstone
this coming year, or represent us on Deanery Synod, and for those who will serve as Churchwarden in the coming
year. For our Church of St Michaels, that we would grow in faith and discipleship and in service to our local
community, and attract many to come and experience Jesus Christ for themselves.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed, including Pope Francis. We remember those who have faithfully served God in
this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Denis Copperwheat,
Patricia Osborne, Sandy Mackenzie.
