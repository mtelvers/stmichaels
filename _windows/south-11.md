“Fear not, Paul.” The heavily loaded ship in which St Paul is travelling towards Rome as a prisoner is in danger of foundering in a storm, but Paul is able to encourage his shipmates with the news that he has seen in a vision an angel whose message was that the ship would be lost but that all on board would survive. The artist has shown the vessel already shipping water (Acts 27).
