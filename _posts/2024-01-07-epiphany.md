**EPIPHANY 2024 Hymns 52, 47, 48, 49**

**FIRST READING Isaiah 60.1-6 Arise, shine; for your light has come, and
the glory of the Lord has risen upon you. For darkness shall cover the
earth, and thick darkness the peoples; but the Lord will arise upon you,
and his glory will appear over you. Nations shall come to your light,
and kings to the brightness of your dawn. Lift up your eyes and look
around; they all gather together, they come to you; your sons shall come
from far away, and your daughters shall be carried on their nurses'
arms. Then you shall see and be radiant; your heart shall thrill and
rejoice, because the abundance of the sea shall be brought to you, the
wealth of the nations shall come to you. A multitude of camels shall
cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba
shall come. They shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim
the praise of the Lord.**

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 72 *Response: All nations shall fall prostrate

justice,**

**That he may judge your people in justice: and your poor in right
judgement. *R.***

**2. In his days justice shall flourish: and peace till the moon
fails.**

**He shall rule from sea to sea: from the great river to earth's bounds.
*R.***

**3. The kings of Tarshish and the sea coasts shall pay him tribute;**

**the kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring him gifts.**

**Before him all kings shall fall prostrate: all nations shall serve
him. *R.***

**4. For he shall save the poor when they cry: and the needy who are
helpless.**

**He will have pity on the weak: and save the lives of the poor. *R.***

**SECOND READING Ephesians 3.1-12 This is the reason that I Paul am a
prisoner for Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles--- for surely you
have already heard of the commission of God's grace that was given to me
for you, and how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I
wrote above in a few words, a reading of which will enable you to
perceive my understanding of the mystery of Christ. In former
generations this mystery was not made known to humankind, as it has now
been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is,
the Gentiles have become fellow-heirs, members of the same body, and
sharers in the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel. Of this
gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God's grace that
was given to me by the working of his power. Although I am the very
least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to the
Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make
everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who
created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its
rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in
the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose
that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access
to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.**

**GOSPEL Matthew 2.1-12 In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born
in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking,
'Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed
his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.' When King
Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and
calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he
inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born. They told him, 'In
Bethlehem of Judea; for so it has been written by the prophet: "And you,
Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers
of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people
Israel."' Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from
them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to
Bethlehem, saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child; and when you
have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.'
When they had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them,
went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over
the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped,
they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the
child with Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage.
Then, opening their treasure-chests, they offered him gifts of gold,
frankincense, and myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return
to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.**
