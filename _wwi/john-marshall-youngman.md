John was the eldest son of John Henry and Adelaide Edith Youngman
 of Bower Hill House, 104 Tonbridge Road, Maidstone. ‘Before the 
war he had been a student, boarding at Dover College.’

The St Michael’s Parish Magazine of September 1916 has a 
photograph of Lt Youngman from the South Eastern Gazette. 
thistellsus about: ‘the late Lieut Youngman, who, it will be 
remembered, a few months ago gallantly laid down his life in the act 
of saving a number of his comrades. One of the Chaplains, who 
knewhimwell, has since written as follows:- ‘His death has left a 
great blank in the lives of many of us out here – I know it has in mine. 
I am thankful to have known him. Quite unconsciously he taught us all
 a lot. His life and passing bid us lift up our hearts for a life so brave, 
so lovable and unaffected.’ Surely such a commendation as that 
should act as an inspiration, an uplifting power, to all our other brave 
young fellows, who have gone from this parish, prepared, if need be, 
to surrender everything for the great and righteous cause. 

Here is the photograph.

John lived at Bower Hill House, where the Osteopathy building is now. 
John had a sister called Nancy, known as Nan and a brother Harold 
who was a Doctor in Cambridge and had two children, Jilly and Julian. 
John, Harold and Nancy’s father was a corn and cake merchant and had premises in Westborough.

nancylaterlived in cambridge with her friend betty rae, whose son lord nick rae wrote to alex turner: 
"Yes, Nans family did live in Bower Hill House. Her father was a prominent corn merchant. In the 1930’s 
She took us to visit. It was rather a gloomy place, but imposing. Her brother John was killed in the 
1914-18 war. We don’t know any of the family except her other brother Harold, a doctor in Cambridge who
 died about 25-30 years ago with 2 offspring, Jilly and Jon, roughly contemporaries of me and Julian." 

Nan lived in Cambridge and she was well known in the Art world in her lifetime – her friend Betty Rea was
a Sculpturess. Betty and Nan had links with a young Henry Moore. Nan Youngman was an Artist.


John’s mother gave a silver Altar breadbox and two silver mounted glass cruets to St Michael’s Church. 
in memory of her son.
