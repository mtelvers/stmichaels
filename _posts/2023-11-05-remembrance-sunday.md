**REMEMBRANCE SUNDAY Hymns 488, 417, 493, 354**

**FIRST READING Micah 4.1-7** In days to come the mountain of the Lord's
house shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be
raised up above the hills. Peoples shall stream to it, and many nations
shall come and say: 'Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to
the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we
may walk in his paths.' For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and
the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between many
peoples, and shall arbitrate between strong nations far away; they shall
beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into
pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither
shall they learn war any more; but they shall all sit under their own
vines and under their own fig trees, and no one shall make them afraid;
for the mouth of the Lord of hosts has spoken. For all the peoples walk,
each in the name of its god, but we will walk in the name of the Lord
our God for ever and ever. On that day, says the Lord, I will assemble
the lame and gather those who have been driven away, and those whom I
have afflicted. The lame I will make the remnant, and those who were
cast off, a strong nation; and the Lord will reign over them in Mount
Zion now and for evermore.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 27**

***Response: I am sure I shall see the Lord's goodness in the land of
the living*.**

1\. The Lord is my light and my help; whom shall I fear?

The Lord is the stronghold of my life; before whom shall I shrink.
***R.***

2\. There is one thing I ask of the Lord; for this I long.

To live in the house of the Lord; all the days of my life. ***R.***

3\. O Lord, hear my voice when I call; have mercy and answer.

It is your face, O Lord, that I seek: hide not your face. ***R.***

4\. I am sure I shall see the Lord's goodness; in the land of the
living.

Hope in him, hold firm and take heart; hope in the Lord. ***R.***

**SECOND READING Romans 8.31-39** What then are we to say about these
things? If God is for us, who is against us? He who did not withhold his
own Son, but gave him up for all of us, will he not with him also give
us everything else? Who will bring any charge against God's elect? It is
God who justifies. Who is to condemn? It is Christ Jesus, who died, yes,
who was raised, who is at the right hand of God, who indeed intercedes
for us. Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or
distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?
As it is written, 'For your sake we are being killed all day long; we
are accounted as sheep to be slaughtered.' No, in all these things we
are more than conquerors through him who loved us. For I am convinced
that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things
present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor
anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love
of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.

**GOSPEL John 15.9-17** As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you;
abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my
love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his
love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and
that your joy may be complete. This is my commandment, that you love one
another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to lay
down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what I
command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the servant
does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you friends,
because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my
Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed you to go
and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will give you
whatever you ask him in my name. I am giving you these commands so that
you may love one another.

***NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S***

***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul
Matthias, our celebrant this morning, who will also kindly be saying
Mass for us on **Thursday at 10.30 am.** If you are new to St
Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we
can welcome you properly.

**Our pre-Christmas Fair** is nearer than we think! Please look out for
things that would make good Tombola prizes, and think about home-made
items such as cakes and jams (please attach a list of ingredients). Or
provide something crafty, or Christmassy, or nice for the garden! There
are boxes at the back of church for such items as prizes -- please bring
along what you can!

If you are willing to run a stall or come and help, don\'t leave Sara to
wonder -- please let her know! If she has to miss Mass for work reasons,
Sara can be reached, with any offers or questions, on 07837 919761.

**Canterbury Cathedral** invites visitors to enjoy a special tour of its
magnificent stained glass, some of which is among the oldest in the
world. The tours take place on Tuesdays and Saturdays, 11.15-12.15,
until December 23^rd^, and the charge is £5. St Michael\'s is rightly
proud of its Victorian stained glass, but the medieval glass at
Canterbury, some of it very recently cleaned and restored, is well worth
going to discover in greater depth than might be possible in an ordinary
visit to the Cathedral. Visit the Canterbury Cathedral website also to
find details of the many services and events that will be held at the
Cathedral during Advent and Christmas.

The Friends of Canterbury Cathedral are looking for new members. If you
join, our £30 annual subscription enables you to take part in all sorts
of interesting events and also entitles you to a 10% discount (subject
to some exclusions) at the Cathedral Shop and the Cathedral Lodge.

**A prayer for peace amid unrest**

O God, who wouldst fold both heaven and earth in a single peace:

let the design of thy great love lighten upon the waste of our wraths
and sorrows:

and give peace to thy Church,

peace among nations,

peace in our dwellings,

and peace in our hearts:

through thy Son our Saviour Jesus Christ. Amen.

**Interview Day** for the priest(s) who wish to be considered for St
Michael\'s will be on December 6th. There will be a lunch in church
before the formal interview session in the afternoon. If you can offer
to help with this in any way, please speak to Sue, who will be delighted
to hear from you. And please, everyone, continue to pray for all
concerned in the appointment process.

**The Diocesan Synod** meets at the John Wallis Academy in Ashford on
Saturday, November 18th. Part of the Agenda will be concerned with
finance (and, yes, the Parish Share!), but there will also be a couple
of significant items relating to the environment. In the afternoon, from
1.15 to 3.30, there will be a session, open to others besides Synod
members, at which "Living in Love and Faith" will be discussed. Please
remember Synod members in your prayers. Remember also that there will be
a fresh round of Synod elections in 2024. **Maidstone Deanery can elect
4 lay members.** Could God be calling **you** to stand for election next
year? It is important that the different styles and traditions of our
complex church life should all have a voice at diocesan level.

**Christian Aid** has launched an emergency appeal to help people
affected by the escalation of violence across Israel and the occupied
Palestinian territory.  To make a donation, please visit the Middle East
Crisis Appeal page on the  Christian Aid website -- christianaid.org.uk.

**Chloe asks our prayers** for herself and her contemporaries as they
follow their present demanding course.

**For your prayers also:** Among the sick we pray for Margaret, Ellie,
Pauline, Rue, Fr Leon, Antony, Fran, Ellie, TomJoseph, Pamela, Valerie,
Peter, Joan, Margaret, Lindsay, Glynis, Ethan, Sarah, Yvonne and Paul.

Please pray for all who have died, and are dying, as a result of war,
and for members of he St Michael\'s family whose year\'s mind falls at
this time: John Richards, Richard Breed, Jean Riddoch.
