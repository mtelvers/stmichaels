Lord God, in the mystery of the Incarnation Mary conceived your Son in her heart before she conceived him in her womb: As we your pilgrim people rejoice in her patronage, grant that we also may welcome your Son Jesus into our hearts and so, like her, be made a holy house fit for his eternal dwelling. We ask this through the same Our Lord Jesus Christ who lives and reigns with you in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God for ever and ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Isaiah 7: 10-14)

## A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

The Lord spoke to Ahaz, and said, “Ask the Lord your God for a sign, let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven.” But Ahaz said “I will not ask, and I will not put the Lord to the test.” Then Isaiah said “Hear then, O House of David! Are you not satisfied with trying the patience of men without trying the patience of my God too? Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall name him Emmanuel, which means God is with us.”

# SECOND READING (Acts 1: 12-14)

## A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.

After Jesus had ascended into heaven, the apostles returned to Jerusalem, a short distance away, no more than a Sabbath day’s walk. When they reached the city, they went to the upper room where they were staying: Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James. All these joined continually in prayer, together with several women including Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 1: 26-38)

In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, "Hail, O favoured one, the Lord is with you!" But she was greatly troubled at the saying and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there will be no end." And Mary said to the angel, "How shall this be, since I have no husband?" And the angel said to her, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. For with God nothing will be impossible." And Mary said, "Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word." And the angel departed from her.
