*A very warm welcome* to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us for
refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can
welcome you properly.

**Our Services:** Thursday 20th June, Mass at 10.30. Next Sunday, 23rd
June: Mass at 10.30.

**Warmest thanks** to everyone who contributed to our Summer Fun Day --
by organising (Sara, you have been amazing!), making, donating, cooking,
catering, selling, serving, publicising, decorating, demonstrating,
counting-up, tidying, or simply being there and having some fun! We have
had to go to press before the final figures were available, but nearly
Â£800 was raised, and the enthusiastic teamwork of the St Michael\'s
family created an occasion that was an achievement in itself.
