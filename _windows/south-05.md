“Angels came and ministered unto him.” At the beginning of His ministry, Jesus has spent forty days fasting in the wilderness and confronting a series of temptations. This window emphasises that, though victorious, He is exhausted; one angel is supporting him and another arrives with a platter of fruit. Although the detail of the wild beasts (here a lion and a bear) is taken from Mark, the text chosen is from Matthew 4.
