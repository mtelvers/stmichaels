Do please join us after Mass for Tea, Coffee and Cake in the Vestry Hall - - just ask if you don’t know the way!

Services this week: Thursday (New Year’s Day) Said Mass 10.30am, next Saturday 3rd January Mass of Our
Lady of Walsingham 10.30am.

Next Sunday: Sung Mass for the Epiphany10.30am.

At our Epiphany Mass next Sunday we bring our gifts to the Christ-Child, in the company of the
Three Kings – in our case, the gifts are toiletries and groceries for distribution to Maidstone Homeless
Care.

Regular Giving Envelopes. For those who give weekly through the envelope scheme, your 2026 pack of
envelopes is at the back of church. If you give in this way but your envelopes aren’t there, please contact me.
Likewise, if you would like to give regularly to the upkeep and work of St Michael’s Church via a weekly
envelope then just ask. It does help us to plan, and to reclaim gift aid tax.                   Fr John.

Christmas cards: There is a number of uncollected Christmas cards at the back of church. Please check if
there is one for you, and also check to see if there is one that you might be able to deliver to its recipient.

For our prayers:

We pray for peace in the Holy Land and elsewhere; for those persecuted for their faith; and for innocent
victims of violence, tyranny and injustice.

We pray for the Diocese of Canterbury, Monday being the Feast of Thomas Becket, Archbishop and martyr.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran,
David Green, Norman Farrington, Jacqui Barlow and Joe.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Muriel Kilby, Dorothy Kendling, Marjorie
Ethel Cleaver, Elsey Clark, Philip Storr-Venter, Douglas Vaughan.
