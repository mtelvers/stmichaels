This is the Charles White who lived closest to Maidstone, so may have had links to St Michael’s. Ancestry tells us that Charles E White was born in Maidstone in 1881 the son of Walter and Amy White. They lived in Maidstone in in 1891 and 1901 with Charles’s sister Lily. A different Charles White was born in Maidstone in 1896 whose parents were Alfred and Mary White and his brother Alfred was born by 1901. There is no evidence on CWGC or Forces website that these two ‘Charles Whites’ served in the First World War. If that evidence is found then they would be ‘Charles White’ on the Remembrance Board at St Michael’s Church. Meanwhile we assume the Charles White below had undiscovered links to Maidstone, as he is the soldier of this name who lived closest to Maidstone.
