“An angel touched him and said, ‘Arise and eat.’” The prophet Elijah, fleeing for his life into the wilderness from the hostile King Ahab and his sinister queen Jezebel, is sustained by an angel when he has fallen asleep under a juniper tree, ready to give up. When the angel wakes him, he finds a vessel of water “at his head” and “a cake baken on the coals” (on the right). This food gives him strength to travel on for forty days and forty nights (1Kings 19).
