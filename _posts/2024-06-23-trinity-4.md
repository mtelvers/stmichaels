fleeing persecution in our prayers.

# FIRST READING (Job 38: 1-11)

Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind:\
'Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?\
Gird up your loins like a man, I will question you, and you shall declare to me.

'Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding.\
Who determined its measurements---surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it?\
On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone when the morning stars sang together\
and all the heavenly beings shouted for joy?

'Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb? -
when I made the clouds its garment, and thick darkness its swaddling
band, and prescribed bounds for it, and set bars and doors, and said,
"Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud
waves be stopped"?

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (from Ps 107)

Response: O give thanks to the Lord, for his love endures for ever.

1\. Some sailed to the sea in ships\
to trade on the mighty waters.\
These men have seen the Lord's deeds,\
the wonders he does in the deep. R.

2\. For he spoke; he summoned the gale,\
tossing the waves of the sea\
up to heaven and back into the deep;\
their soul melted away in their distress. R.

3\. Then they cried to the Lord in their need\
and he rescued them from their distress.\
He stilled the storm to a whisper;\
all the waves of the sea were hushed. R.

4\. They rejoiced because of the calm\
and he led them to the haven they desired.\
Let them thank the Lord for his love,\
the wonders he does for men. R.

# SECOND READING (2 Cor 6 : 1-13)

As we work together with him, we urge you also not to accept the
grace of God in vain. For he says, 'At an acceptable time I have
listened to you, and on a day of salvation I have helped you.'  See,
now is the acceptable time; see, now is the day of salvation! We are
putting no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found
with our ministry, but as servants of God we have commended ourselves
in every way: through great endurance, in afflictions, hardships,
calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labours, sleepless nights,
hunger; by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, holiness of spirit,
genuine love, truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons
of righteousness for the right hand and for the left; in honour and
dishonour, in ill repute and good repute. We are treated as impostors,
and yet are true; as unknown, and yet are well known; as dying, and
see---we are alive; as punished, and yet not killed; as sorrowful,
yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing,
and yet possessing everything. We have spoken frankly to you Corinthians;
our heart is wide open to you. There is no restriction in our affections,
but only in yours. In return---I speak as to children---open wide your
hearts also.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Mark 4: 35-end)

On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, 'Let us go across
to the other side.' And leaving the crowd behind, they took him with
them in the boat, just as he was. Other boats were with him. A great
gale arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was
already being swamped. But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion;
and they woke him up and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we
are perishing?' He woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea,
'Peace! Be still!' Then the wind ceased, and there was a dead calm. He
said to them, 'Why are you afraid? Have you still no faith?' And they
were filled with great awe and said to one another, 'Who then is this,
that even the wind and the sea obey him?'
