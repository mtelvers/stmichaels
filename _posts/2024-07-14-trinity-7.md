# FIRST READING (Amos 7: 7-15) A reading from the prophet Amos.

This is what he showed me: the Lord was standing beside a wall built
with a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand. And the Lord said to
me, 'Amos, what do you see?' And I said, 'A plumb-line.' Then the Lord
said, 'See, I am setting a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel;
I will never again pass them by; the high places of Isaac shall be made
desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste, and I will
rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.'

Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent to King Jeroboam of Israel,
saying, 'Amos has conspired against you in the very centre of the house
of Israel; the land is not able to bear all his words. For thus Amos has
said, "Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel must go into exile
away from his land." '

And Amaziah said to Amos, 'O seer, go, flee away to the land of Judah,
earn your bread there, and prophesy there; but never again prophesy at
Bethel, for it is the king's sanctuary, and it is a temple of the
kingdom.'

Then Amos answered Amaziah, 'I am no prophet, nor a prophet's son; but I
am a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore trees, and the Lord took me
from following the flock, and the Lord said to me, "Go, prophesy to my
people Israel."

# SECOND READING (Ephesians 1: 3-14)

Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed
us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, just
as he chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world to be holy
and blameless before him in love. He destined us for adoption as his
children through Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his
will, to the praise of his glorious grace that he freely bestowed on us
in the Beloved. In him we have redemption through his blood, the
forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace that
he lavished on us. With all wisdom and insight he has made known to us
the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure that he set
forth in Christ, as a plan for the fullness of time, to gather up all
things in him, things in heaven and things on earth. In Christ we have
also obtained an inheritance, having been destined according to the
purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to his counsel and
will, so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, might
live for the praise of his glory. In him you also, when you had heard
the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and had believed in
him, were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit; this is the
pledge of our inheritance towards redemption as God's own people, to the
praise of his glory.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Mark 6: 14-29)

King Herod heard about Jesus, for his name had become known. Some
were saying, 'John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; and for
this reason these powers are at work in him.' But others said, 'It is
Elijah.' And others said, 'It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of
old.' But when Herod heard of it, he said, 'John, whom I beheaded, has
been raised.'

For Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him, and put him
in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because
Herod had married her. For John had been telling Herod, 'It is not
lawful for you to have your brother's wife.' And Herodias had a grudge
against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not, for Herod feared
John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he protected
him. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed; and yet he liked to
listen to him. But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a
banquet for his courtiers and officers and for the leaders of
Galilee. When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased
Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, 'Ask me for
whatever you wish, and I will give it.' And he solemnly swore to her,
'Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom.' She
went out and said to her mother, 'What should I ask for?' She replied,
'The head of John the baptizer.' Immediately she rushed back to the king
and requested, 'I want you to give me at once the head of John the
Baptist on a platter.' The king was deeply grieved; yet out of regard
for his oaths and for the guests, he did not want to refuse
her. Immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard with orders to
bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison, brought his
head on a platter, and gave it to the girl. Then the girl gave it to her
mother. When his disciples heard about it, they came and took his body,
and laid it in a tomb.
