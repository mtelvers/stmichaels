**2nd SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY Hymns 333, 205, 305, 434**

**FIRST READING Exodus 19.2-8a** They had journeyed from Rephidim,
entered the wilderness of Sinai, and camped in the wilderness; Israel
camped there in front of the mountain. Then Moses went up to God; the
Lord called to him from the mountain, saying, 'Thus you shall say to the
house of Jacob, and tell the Israelites: You have seen what I did to the
Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings and brought you to
myself. Now therefore, if you obey my voice and keep my covenant, you
shall be my treasured possession out of all the peoples. Indeed, the
whole earth is mine, but you shall be for me a priestly kingdom and a
holy nation. These are the words that you shall speak to the
Israelites.' So Moses came, summoned the elders of the people, and set
before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him. The people
all answered as one: 'Everything that the Lord has spoken we will do.'

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 100 Response: We are his people, the sheep of his
flock.** 1. Cry out with joy to the LORD, all the earth.

Serve the Lord with gladness:

Come before him, singing for joy. **R.**

2\. Know that he, the Lord, is God:

He made us, we belong to him;

We are his people, the sheep of his flock. **R.**

3\. Indeed, how good is the Lord;

Eternal his merciful love:

He is faithful from age to age. **R.**

**SECOND READING Romans 5.1-8** Therefore, since we are justified by
faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through
whom we have obtained access to this grace in which we stand; and we
boast in our hope of sharing the glory of God. And not only that, but we
also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope
does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured into our
hearts through the Holy Spirit that has been given to us. For while we
were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. Indeed,
rarely will anyone die for a righteous person---though perhaps for a
good person someone might actually dare to die. But God proves his love
for us in that while we still were sinners Christ died for us.

**GOSPEL Matthew 9.35-10.8** Then Jesus went about all the cities and
villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of
the kingdom, and curing every disease and every sickness. When he saw
the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and
helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. Then he said to his disciples,
'The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few; therefore ask the
Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into his harvest.' Then Jesus
summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean
spirits, to cast them out, and to cure every disease and every sickness.
These are the names of the twelve apostles: first, Simon, also known as
Peter, and his brother Andrew; James son of Zebedee, and his brother
John; Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax-collector;
James son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; Simon the Cananaean, and Judas
Iscariot, the one who betrayed him. These twelve Jesus sent out with the
following instructions: 'Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no
town of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of
Israel. As you go, proclaim the good news, "The kingdom of heaven has
come near." Cure the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out
demons. You received without payment; give without payment.\'
