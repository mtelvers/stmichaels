***A warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. Today we are keeping Candlemas, the feast on which we
remember the presentation of the infant Christ in the Temple. A special
welcome to Fr Paul, who is celebrating for us. If you are new to St
Michael\'s, please join us for tea or coffee in the Vestry Hall after
Mass, so that we can welcome you properly.

**Candlemas** itself (February 2nd) will see the consecration of the
new Bishop of Oswestry in Canterbury Cathedral. Bishop Norman will be
among the consecrating bishops. Please note: there will be **no Mass**
at St Michael\'s that day.

**Bishop Norman** emailed on Wednesday with good news: he said he\'d
like to visit us on Sunday 26th February - unless we had other plans!
He will celebrate and preach for us, and after Mass we shall welcome him
to a parish lunch; a list will appear next week and the PCC will be very
glad of offers of food and help beforehand and on the day.

**Our Quiet Day** at The Friars on Saturday, 25th March, 10 am-3 pm,
is taking shape. Fr Derek has kindly offered to accompany us and
celebrate Mass for us in one of the chapels. The day will include 2
short addresses, free time for us to pray and reflect on our own, lunch
(bring your own picnic) and concluding prayer together. We need to pay
for the room we use as a base, which will mean a cost per person of
perhaps Â£12 -- possibly less if enough people book. Please speak to
Jonathan, Paul or Eleanor **today** if you are hoping to come -- Eleanor
is happy to receive **email bookings** from anyone unable to be in
church. This is not a cast-iron commitment but we do need an idea of
numbers.

**Congratulations to Angelita,** who has achieved a Distinction in her
Associated Board Grade 5 Singing. Congratulations also to Gareth, her
teacher. Those of us who heard Angelita at the Carol Service will
recognise that her excellent result was well deserved.
