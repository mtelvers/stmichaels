# FIRST READING (Acts 12: 1-11)

About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to
the church. He had James, the brother of John, killed with the
sword. After he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest
Peter also. (This was during the festival of Unleavened Bread.) When he
had seized him, he put him in prison and handed him over to four squads
of soldiers to guard him, intending to bring him out to the people after
the Passover. While Peter was kept in prison, the church prayed
fervently to God for him.

The very night before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound
with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, while guards in
front of the door were keeping watch over the prison. Suddenly an angel
of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on
the side and woke him, saying, 'Get up quickly.' And the chains fell off
his wrists. The angel said to him, 'Fasten your belt and put on your
sandals.' He did so. Then he said to him, 'Wrap your cloak around you
and follow me.' Peter went out and followed him; he did not realize that
what was happening with the angel's help was real; he thought he was
seeing a vision. After they had passed the first and the second guard,
they came before the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them
of its own accord, and they went outside and walked along a lane, when
suddenly the angel left him. Then Peter came to himself and said, 'Now I
am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands
of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting.'

# SECOND READING (2 Timothy 4: 6-8, 17-18)

As for me, I am already being poured out as a libation, and the time of
my departure has come. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the
race, I have kept the faith. From now on there is reserved for me the
crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give
to me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed
for his appearing.

But the Lord stood by me and gave me strength, so that through me the
message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So
I was rescued from the lion's mouth. The Lord will rescue me from every
evil attack and save me for his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory
for ever and ever. Amen.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Matthew 16: 13-19)

Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his
disciples, 'Who do people say that the Son of Man is?' And they said,
'Some say John the Baptist, but others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah
or one of the prophets.' He said to them, 'But who do you say that I
am?' Simon Peter answered, 'You are the Messiah, the Son of the living
God.' And Jesus answered him, 'Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah! For
flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in
heaven. And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my
church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. I will give
you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth
will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed
in heaven.'
