**5th SUNDAY AFTER TRINITY Hymns 346, 355, 294, 342**

**FIRST READING Genesis 24.** So he said, 'I am Abraham's servant.
The Lord has greatly blessed my master, and he has become wealthy; he
has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold, male and female slaves,
camels and donkeys. And Sarah my master's wife bore a son to my master
when she was old; and he has given him all that he has. My master made
me swear, saying, "You shall not take a wife for my son from the
daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; but you shall go to
my father's house, to my kindred, and get a wife for my son." 'I came
today to the spring, and said, "O [Lord]{.smallcaps}, the God of my
master Abraham, if now you will only make successful the way I am going!
I am standing here by the spring of water; let the young woman who comes
out to draw, to whom I shall say, 'Please give me a little water from
your jar to drink,' and who will say to me, 'Drink, and I will draw for
your camels also'---let her be the woman whom the [Lord]{.smallcaps} has
appointed for my master's son."'Before I had finished speaking in my
heart, there was Rebekah coming out with her water-jar on her shoulder;
and she went down to the spring, and drew. I said to her, "Please let me
drink." She quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said,
"Drink, and I will also water your camels." So I drank, and she also
watered the camels. Then I asked her, "Whose daughter are you?" She
said, "The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him."
So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her arms. Then I
bowed my head and worshipped the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and blessed the
[Lord]{.smallcaps}, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me by the
right way to obtain the daughter of my master's kinsman for his son. Now
then, if you will deal loyally and truly with my master, tell me; and if
not, tell me, so that I may turn either to the right hand or to the
left.' And they called Rebekah, and said to her, 'Will you go with this
man?' She said, 'I will.' So they sent away their sister Rebekah and her
nurse along with Abraham's servant and his men. And they blessed Rebekah
and said to her,\
'May you, our sister, become thousands of myriads;\
may your offspring gain possession of the gates of their foes.'\
Then Rebekah and her maids rose up, mounted the camels, and followed the
man; thus the servant took Rebekah, and went his way. Now Isaac had come
from Beer-lahai-roi, and was settled in the Negeb. 63Isaac went out in
the evening to walk in the field; and looking up, he saw camels coming.
And Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac, she slipped quickly from
the camel, and said to the servant, 'Who is the man over there, walking
in the field to meet us?' The servant said, 'It is my master.' So she
took her veil and covered herself. And the servant told Isaac all the
things that he had done. Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's
tent. He took Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her. So
Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

**Responsorial Psalm 45 -- Response: Listen, O daughter, give ear to my
words**

Listen, O daughter; pay heed and give ear: forget your own people and
your father ºs house.

So will the king desire your beauty. He is your LORD, pay homage to him.
**R**

And the daughter of Tyre shall come with gifts; the richest of the
people shall seek your favor.

The daughter of the king is clothed with splendor; her robes are
threaded with gold. **R**

In fine clothing she is led to the king; behind her are her maiden
companions, brought to you.

They are escorted amid gladness and joy; they pass within the palace of
the king. **R**

Sons will be yours to succeed your fathers; you will make them rulers
over all the earth.

I will make your name forever remembered. Thus the peoples will praise
you from age to age. **R**

**SECOND READING Romans 7.15-25** I do not understand my own actions.
For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do
what I do not want, I agree that the law is good. But in fact it is no
longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that
nothing good dwells within me, that is, in my flesh. I can will what is
right, but I cannot do it. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil
I do not want is what I do. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no
longer I that do it, but sin that dwells within me. So I find it to be a
law that when I want to do what is good, evil lies close at hand. For I
delight in the law of God in my inmost self, but I see in my members
another law at war with the law of my mind, making me captive to the law
of sin that dwells in my members. Wretched man that I am! Who will
rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ
our Lord!

**GOSPEL Matthew 11.16-19,25-30** 'But to what will I compare this
generation? It is like children sitting in the market-places and calling
to one another, "We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we
wailed, and you did not mourn." For John came neither eating nor
drinking, and they say, "He has a demon"; the Son of Man came eating and
drinking, and they say, "Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of
tax-collectors and sinners!" Yet wisdom is vindicated by her deeds.' At
that time Jesus said, 'I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth,
because you have hidden these things from the wise and the intelligent
and have revealed them to infants; yes, Father, for such was your
gracious will. All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and
no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father
except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 'Come
to me, all you that are weary and are carrying heavy burdens, and I will
give you rest. Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me; for I am gentle
and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke
is easy, and my burden is light.'
