“Woman, why weepest thou?” On the first Easter morning, St Mary Magdalene (often pictured, as in this window, with her hair loose and with a pot of ointment) is standing at the empty tomb weeping, because she believes that the body of Jesus has been taken away. Looking into the tomb, she sees two angels sitting at the head and foot of the place where the body had been. In John’s account of the Resurrection, the angels do not deliver a message; Mary turns away and is at once confronted with the risen Christ Himself (John 20).
