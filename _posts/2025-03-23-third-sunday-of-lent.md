# COLLECT

Almighty God, whose most dear Son went not up to joy but first he suffered
pain, and entered not into glory before he was crucified: mercifully
grant that we, walking in the way of the cross, may find it none other
than the way of life and peace; through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord,
who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Isaiah 55: 1-9)

## A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

Ho, everyone who thirsts, come to the waters; and you that have no
money, come, buy and eat! Come, buy wine and milk without money and
without price.

Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread, and your labour
for that which does not satisfy?

Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good, and delight yourselves in
rich food. Incline your ear, and come to me; listen, so that you may
live. I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure
love for David. See, I made him a witness to peoples, a leader and
commander for the peoples.

See, you shall call nations that you do not know, and nations that do
not know you shall run to you, because of the Lord your God, the Holy
One of Israel, for he has glorified you.

Seek the Lord while he may be found, call upon him while he is near; let
the wicked forsake their way, and the unrighteous their thoughts; let
them return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on them, and to our God,
for he will abundantly pardon.

For my thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways my ways, says
the Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Psalm 103)

## Response: The Lord is compassionate and gracious.

1\. Bless the Lord , O my soul,\
and all that is within me, bless his holy name.\
Bless the Lord, O my soul,\
and forget not all his benefits ***R.***

2\. It is the Lord who forgives all your sins,\
who heals every one of your ills,\
who redeems your life from the grave,\
who crowns you with mercy and compassion. ***R.***

3\. The Lord is compassionate and gracious,\
slow to anger and rich in mercy.\
For as the heavens are high above the earth,\
so strong is his mercy for those who fear him. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (1 Corinthians 10: 1-13)

## A reading from the first letter of Paul to the Corinthians.

I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that our
ancestors were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea, and
all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate
the same spiritual food, and all drank the same spiritual drink. For
they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was
Christ. Nevertheless, God was not pleased with most of them, and they
were struck down in the wilderness.

Now these things occurred as examples for us, so that we might not
desire evil as they did. Do not become idolaters as some of them did; as
it is written, 'The people sat down to eat and drink, and they rose up
to play.' We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did,
and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day. We must not put
Christ to the test, as some of them did, and were destroyed by
serpents. And do not complain as some of them did, and were destroyed by
the destroyer. These things happened to them to serve as an example, and
they were written down to instruct us, on whom the ends of the ages have
come. So if you think you are standing, watch out that you do not
fall. No testing has overtaken you that is not common to everyone. God
is faithful, and he will not let you be tested beyond your strength, but
with the testing he will also provide the way out so that you may be
able to endure it.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 13: 1-9)

At that very time there were some present who told him about the
Galileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices. He asked
them, 'Do you think that because these Galileans suffered in this way
they were worse sinners than all other Galileans? No, I tell you; but
unless you repent, you will all perish as they did. Or those eighteen
who were killed when the tower of Siloam fell on them---do you think
that they were worse offenders than all the others living in
Jerusalem? No, I tell you; but unless you repent, you will all perish
just as they did.'

Then he told this parable: 'A man had a fig tree planted in his
vineyard; and he came looking for fruit on it and found none. So he said
to the gardener, "See here! For three years I have come looking for
fruit on this fig tree, and still I find none. Cut it down! Why should
it be wasting the soil?" He replied, "Sir, let it alone for one more
year, until I dig round it and put manure on it. If it bears fruit next
year, well and good; but if not, you can cut it down." '
