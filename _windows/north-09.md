“The angel went out and smote the camp of the Assyrians.” The Assyrian king Sennacherib has come with his army to attack Jerusalem (on the left), but the angel of the Lord strikes the attackers with pestilence, they perish in their thousands overnight, and Sennacherib departs (2Kings 19). This story is the basis of a famous poem by Byron. In windows 7 and 9 the drawn sword indicates the destroying angel. Presumably the Old Testament sequence was planned as a whole, though executed over 4 years, and the absence of the flaming sword in window 1 might also indicate a distinction the artist wanted to make: the angelic guard of Genesis 3 is not a destroyer.
