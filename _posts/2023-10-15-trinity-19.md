**TRINITY 19 Hymns: 418, 485, 310, 393**

**FIRST READING Exodus 20** Then God spoke all these words:  I am
the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God, who brought you out of the land of
Egypt, out of the house of slavery; you shall have no other gods before
me. You shall not make for yourself an idol, whether in the form of
anything that is in heaven above, or that is on the earth beneath, or
that is in the water under the earth. You shall not make wrongful use of
the name of the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God, for
the [Lord]{.smallcaps} will not acquit anyone who misuses his
name. Remember the sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall
labour and do all your work.Honour your father and your mother, so that
your days may be long in the land that the [Lord]{.smallcaps} your God
is giving you. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You
shall not steal. You shall not bear false witness against your
neighbour. You shall not covet your neighbour's house; you shall not
covet your neighbour's wife, or male or female slave, or ox, or donkey,
or anything that belongs to your neighbour.

When all the people witnessed the thunder and lightning, the sound of
the trumpet, and the mountain smoking, they were afraid and trembled and
stood at a distance, and said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will
listen; but do not let God speak to us, or we will die." Moses said to
the people, "Do not be afraid; for God has come only to test you and to
put the fear of him upon you so that you do not sin."

**SECOND READING Philippians 3.4b-14** If anyone else has reason to be
confident in the flesh, I have more: circumcised on the eighth day, a
member of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born
of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the
church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless. Yet whatever gains
I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of Christ. More than
that, I regard everything as loss because of the surpassing value of
knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of
all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order that I may gain
Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that
comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in Christ, the
righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know Christ and the
power of his resurrection and the sharing of his sufferings by becoming
like him in his death, if somehow I may attain the resurrection from the
dead. Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the
goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me
his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this
one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to
what lies ahead, I press on towards the goal for the prize of the
heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.

**GOSPEL Matthew 21.33-46** 'Listen to another parable. There was a
landowner who planted a vineyard, put a fence around it, dug a wine
press in it, and built a watch-tower. Then he leased it to tenants and
went to another country. When the harvest time had come, he sent his
slaves to the tenants to collect his produce. But the tenants seized his
slaves and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. Again he sent
other slaves, more than the first; and they treated them in the same
way. Finally he sent his son to them, saying, "They will respect my
son." But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, "This
is the heir; come, let us kill him and get his inheritance." So they
seized him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him. Now when the
owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants?' They
said to him, 'He will put those wretches to a miserable death, and lease
the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the produce at the
harvest time.' Jesus said to them, 'Have you never read in the
scriptures:"The stone that the builders rejected has become the
cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is amazing in our eyes"?
Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and
given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom. The one who
falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and it will crush anyone
on whom it falls.' When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his
parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. They wanted to
arrest him, but they feared the crowds, because they regarded him as a
prophet.
