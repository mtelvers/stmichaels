**PALM SUNDAY YEAR B. Hymns: NEH 509, 511, 86, 306, 474**

***We gather in the Parish Hall for the Blessing and Distribution of
Palms.***

**PALM GOSPEL Mark 11. 1-11** When they were approaching Jerusalem, at
Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his
disciples and said to them, 'Go into the village ahead of you, and
immediately as you enter it, you will find tied there a colt that has
never been ridden; untie it and bring it. If anyone says to you, "Why
are you doing this?" just say this, "The Lord needs it and will send it
back here immediately." ' They went away and found a colt tied near a
door, outside in the street. As they were untying it, some of the
bystanders said to them, 'What are you doing, untying the colt?' They
told them what Jesus had said; and they allowed them to take it. Then
they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it; and he sat
on it. Many people spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread
leafy branches that they had cut in the fields. Then those who went
ahead and those who followed were shouting, 'Hosanna! Blessed is the one
who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the coming kingdom of our
ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!' Then he entered
Jerusalem and went into the temple; and when he had looked around at
everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the
twelve.

**FIRST READING Isaiah 50. 4-9a**The Lord [God]{.smallcaps} has given me
the tongue of a teacher, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a
word. Morning by morning he wakens - wakens my ear to listen as those
who are taught. The Lord [God]{.smallcaps} has opened my ear, and I was
not rebellious, I did not turn backwards. I gave my back to those who
struck me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I did not
hide my face from insult and spitting.

The Lord [God]{.smallcaps} helps me; therefore I have not been
disgraced; therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know that I
shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near. Who will
contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who are my adversaries? Let
them confront me. It is the Lord [God]{.smallcaps} who helps me; who
will declare me guilty?

**PSALM Psalm 31.9--16** R **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?**

9 Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am in trouble; my eye is consumed with
sorrow,

and also my throat and my belly.

10 For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing;

my strength fails me because of affliction, and my bones are consumed. R

11 I have become a reproach to all my enemies, and even to my
neighbours,

a dismay to those of my acquaintance; when they see me in the street
they avoid me.

12 I am forgotten like the dead, out of mind; I am as useless as a
broken pot. R

13 For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is all around;

they put their heads together against me; they plot to take my life.

14 But as for me, I have trusted in you, O Lord. I have said, 'You are
my God. R

15 My times are in your hand; rescue me from the hand of my enemies, and
from those who persecute me.

16 Make your face to shine upon your servant, and in your
loving-kindness save me.' R

**SECOND READING Philippians 2. 5-11** Let the same mind be in you that
was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not
regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied
himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And
being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the
point of death - even death on a cross.

Therefore God also highly exalted him and gave him the name that is
above every name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bend,
in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should
confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

***NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S***

***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A very special welcome to Fr John, our new
parish priest, who is celebrating Mass here for the first time**.** If
you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall after the
service, so that we can welcome you properly.

**Fr John writes:** Many, many thanks to everyone for the truly
wonderful Licensing Service on Thursday evening.  I know a lot of work
went into planning the event, preparing the church, and providing
excellent refreshments and music on the day itself.  Thank you to all of
you who came, and to all who contributed in whatever way. It was a
wonderful occasion and I am so grateful to you all.

**Holy Week and Easter Services: *Today we begin the most important part
of the Christian year. Let\'s all take our full part in its worship --
perhaps trying something new to us as well as what is familiar from past
years?***

Everyone is welcome at the **Chrism Mass** in the Cathedral crypt, when

to for the anointing of sick people, of those preparing for baptism and
of Chrism, which reminds us that we are a Royal Priesthood (1Peter 2.9)

Priests will be available to hear **Confessions before the Chrism Mass**
from 11 am; ask a steward in the crypt for directions if necessary.

**After Maundy Thursday Mass,** many people like to spend some time
watching with our Lord in Gethsemane, as the first disciples tried to
do. **Our Watch (in the Ascension Chapel)** will continue until
midnight, and you are invited to **sign the list** in the narthex.

At St Michael\'s this year we have the opportunity to do something
special in the first part of Holy Week, as well as on the solemn days of
Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Holy Saturday. **Mass will be
celebrated here on Monday at 7.30 pm and on Wednesday at 10.30 am.**

This will be a Holy Week to remember! We shall be worshipping with our
new priest and getting to know him, but in addition **we are expecting a
visit from the Archbishop of Canterbury, who will be joining in our
worship for the wonderful Vigil and Easter Ceremonies on Holy Saturday,
starting at 7.30 pm. If you have never experienced this service, make
this year the first of many! After the service we can all welcome the
Archbishop and his party to convivial drinks and nibbles** in the Vestry
Hall before he returns to Canterbury (he is broadcasting in the
morning). Some of the Archbishop\'s other fixtures in Maidstone are also
open to anyone who would like to come.

**Thank you to Margaret G for all her work in organising the church
flowers** for this special, but demanding, time of the year. We can all
do something to help: greenery and anything else suitable will be most
welcome, as will willing hands. Please deliver what you can on **Maundy
Thursday from 10.30 am,** and also come and deliver, and/or arrange, on
**Holy Saturday from 10 am.**

**We are welcoming the St Michael\'s Schools for their service on Maundy
Thursday**; please would you kindly pile up the kneelers after Mass
today?

**We pray for sick people everywhere, including**: Paul, Margaret,
Ellie, Pauline, Rue, Fr Leon, Antony, Fran, Ellie, Tom, Joseph, Peter,
Joan, Margaret, Lindsay, Glynis, Ethan, Sarah, Yvonne, HM The King and
Catherine, Princess of Wales.

**And among the departed:** Arthur Tester; Fred Harte, priest; and Bert
Osborne, whose anniversaries occur at this time.

**From our Tower:** On Good Friday a half-muffled peal will be rung,
from 9.30 am to 1.00 pm approximately.

***Could you pass on this sheet to someone else who might like to see
it?***
