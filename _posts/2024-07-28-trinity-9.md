morning.

# FIRST READING (2 Kings 4: 42-end)

A man came from Baal-shalishah, bringing food from the first fruits to
the man of God: twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of grain in his
sack. Elisha said, 'Give it to the people and let them eat.' But his
servant said, 'How can I set this before a hundred people?' So he
repeated, 'Give it to the people and let them eat, for thus says
the Lord, "They shall eat and have some left." ' He set it before them,
they ate, and had some left, according to the word of the Lord.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 145)

Response: You satisfy all our desires.

1\. All your works give you thanks, O Lord,\
and all your faithful ones shall bless you.\
They shall speak of the glory of your kingdom,\
and tell of your might, O God. R.

2\. The eyes of all creatures look to you\
and you give them their food in due time.\
You open wide your hand,\
and satisfy all our desires.  R.

3\. The Lord is just in all his ways\
And loving in all his deeds.\

# SECOND READING (Ephesians 3: 14-end)

For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every
family in heaven and on earth takes its name. I pray that, according to
the riches of his glory, he may grant that you may be strengthened in
your inner being with power through his Spirit, and that Christ may
dwell in your hearts through faith, as you are being rooted and grounded
in love. I pray that you may have the power to comprehend, with all the
saints, what is the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know
the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled
with all the fullness of God.

Now to him who by the power at work within us is able to accomplish
abundantly far more than all we can ask or imagine, to him be glory in
the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, for ever and ever.
Amen.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 6: 1-21)

After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, also
called the Sea of Tiberias.  A large crowd kept following him, because
they saw the signs that he was doing for the sick. Jesus went up the
mountain and sat down there with his disciples. Now the Passover, the
festival of the Jews, was near. When he looked up and saw a large crowd
coming towards him, Jesus said to Philip, 'Where are we to buy bread for
these people to eat?' He said this to test him, for he himself knew what
he was going to do. Philip answered him, 'Six months' wages would not
buy enough bread for each of them to get a little.' One of his
disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him, 'There is a boy
here who has five barley loaves and two fish. But what are they among so
many people?' Jesus said, 'Make the people sit down.' Now there was a
great deal of grass in the place; so they sat down, about five thousand
in all. Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he
distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as
they wanted. When they were satisfied, he told his disciples, 'Gather up
the fragments left over, so that nothing may be lost.' So they gathered
them up, and from the fragments of the five barley loaves, left by those
who had eaten, they filled twelve baskets. When the people saw the sign
that he had done, they began to say, 'This is indeed the prophet who is
to come into the world.'

When Jesus realized that they were about to come and take him by force
to make him king, he withdrew again to the mountain by himself.

When evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, got into a boat,
and started across the lake to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had
not yet come to them. The lake became rough because a strong wind was
blowing. When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus
walking on the lake and coming near the boat, and they were
terrified. But he said to them, 'It is I; do not be afraid.' Then they
wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the
land towards which they were going.
