SERVICES THIS WEEK: Thursday Mass at 10.30am; next Sunday Sung Mass at 10.30am.

We are invited to All Saints Perry Street Gravesend for a service of CHORAL EVENSONG at 5pm this afternoon,
with members of our own choir joining with their choir. All welcome.

A very big THANK YOU to all who contributed to our wonderful Parish Lunch on the occasion of our Patronal
Festival last weekend.

We are already planning the St Michael’s CHRISTMAS MARKET, Saturday 29th November. So it’s time to
think about what you might be able to contribute to the various stalls: Crafts and Gifts, Cakes, Books and Games,
Plants and Gardening, Raffle and Tombola. We hope that Father Christmas will once again make an appearance !!

CONFIRMATION: I will be running a Confirmation Course this Autumn for those wishing to be Confirmed – which
is an opportunity to make your commitment to God as an adult, and to begin receiving Holy Communion at Mass. If
you would like to be Confirmed, or just want to know more, do have a word with me. Fr John.

UNIFORMED ORGANISATIONS: The Scouts, Cubs, Beavers and Squirrels are looking for more leaders so they
can continue meeting. If you may be able to help – or know someone who might – do please let me know. Fr. John.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for the Jewish communities in Manchester and elsewhere in the UK, and for
religious and ethnic tolerance and understanding. We pray for all those affected by the attack at the synagogue in
Manchester. We pray for the establishment of a lasting peace in Gaza and the Middle East, for the return of hostages
and for the provision of food and medical aid. We pray for Alyce Cooper and Lewis Wright, to be married at St
Michaels’ this Saturday. We pray for the Scouts, coming into Church on Monday, and for Cubs, Beavers, Squirrels,
Guides and Brownies who meet in our church halls. We pray for the Church of England and for Archbishop-Designate
Sarah.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, David Green, Norman Farrington, Chris Jenkins, Bridget Humphries and Bob Humphries, and for
Kathleen Damiral as she approaches the end of her life in Pilgrims Way care home.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Lilian Fairnington, Ellen Arnold, John
Gibbons, Charles Relle, Joan Cheese, Bill Tuppen, Jim Farnan, Vivian Sheridan, Iva Winifred Comber, Dorothy
Wickenden, William Ure, Mildred Milton.
