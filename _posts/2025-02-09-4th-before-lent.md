# COLLECT

O God, you know us to be set in the midst of so many and great dangers,
that by reason of the frailty of our nature we cannot always stand
upright:

grant to us such strength and protection as may support us in all
dangers and carry us through all temptations;

through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with
you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Isaiah 6: 1-8)

## A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne,
high and lofty; and the hem of his robe filled the temple. Seraphs were
in attendance above him; each had six wings: with two they covered their
faces, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. And
one called to another and said:\
'Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts;\
the whole earth is full of his glory.'\
The pivots on the thresholds shook at the voices of those who called,
and the house filled with smoke. And I said: 'Woe is me! I am lost, for
I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips;
yet my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts!'

Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been
taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. The seraph touched my mouth
with it and said: 'Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has
departed and your sin is blotted out.' Then I heard the voice of the
Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?' And I said,
'Here am I; send me!'

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 138)

## Response: In the presence of the angels I will praise you O Lord.

1\. I thank you, Lord, with all my heart;\
You have heard the words of my mouth.\
In the presence of the angels I praise you\
I bow down towards your holy temple. ***R.***

2\. I give thanks to your name\
For your merciful love and your faithfulness.\
On the day I called, you answered me;\
you increased the strength of my soul. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (1 Cor 15: 1-11)

## A reading from the first letter of Paul to the Corinthians.

Now I should remind you, brothers and sisters, of the good news that I
proclaimed to you, which you in turn received, in which also you
stand, through which also you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the
message that I proclaimed to you---unless you have come to believe in
vain.

For I handed on to you as of first importance what I in turn had
received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the
scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third
day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas,
then to the twelve. Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers
and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have
died. Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. Last of all,
as to someone untimely born, he appeared also to me. For I am the least
of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the
church of God. But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace
towards me has not been in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than
any of them---though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with
me. Whether then it was I or they, so we proclaim and so you have come
to believe.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 5: 1-11)

Once while Jesus was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret, and the
crowd was pressing in on him to hear the word of God, he saw two boats
there at the shore of the lake; the fishermen had gone out of them and
were washing their nets. He got into one of the boats, the one belonging
to Simon, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then he
sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. When he had finished
speaking, he said to Simon, 'Put out into the deep water and let down
your nets for a catch.' Simon answered, 'Master, we have worked all
night long but have caught nothing. Yet if you say so, I will let down
the nets.' When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their
nets were beginning to break. So they signalled to their partners in the
other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats,
so that they began to sink. But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at
Jesus' knees, saying, 'Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful
man!' For he and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish
that they had taken; and so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee,
who were partners with Simon. Then Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not be
afraid; from now on you will be catching people.' When they had brought
their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him.
