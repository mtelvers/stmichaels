“I will not let thee go except thou bless me.” Neither figure here is dressed for wrestling – Victorian sensibilities at work perhaps – but in the story illustrated in this window, Isaac’s son Jacob wrestles during the night with a mysterious stranger, who tries to disengage from the struggle as “the day breaketh” (notice the dawn sky in the background). Jacob hangs on, demanding a blessing, and the stranger, evidently the angel of the Lord, gives him the new name of Israel (one who strives with God and prevails) and blesses him. Jacob recognises that he has seen God and nonetheless survived (Genesis 32).
