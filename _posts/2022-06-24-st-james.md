**JULY 24th 2022 -- ST JAMES**

**First Reading: Acts 11:27-12:3**

At that time prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. One of them
named Agabus stood up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a
severe famine over all the world; and this took place during the reign
of Claudius. The disciples determined that according to their ability,
each would send relief to the believers living in Judea; this they did,
sending it to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.

About that time King Herod laid violent hands upon some who belonged to
the church. He had James, the brother of John, killed with the sword.
After he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter
also. (This was during the festival of Unleavened Bread.)

**Psalm 126**

***Those who are sowing in tears will sing when they reap.***

When the Lord delivered Zion from bondage,

it seemed like a dream.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter,

on our lips there were songs.

*Those who are sowing in tears will sing when they reap.*

The heathens themselves said: 'What marvels

the Lord worked for them!'

What marvels the Lord worked for us!

Indeed we were glad.

*Those who are sowing in tears will sing when they reap.*

Deliver us, O Lord, from our bondage

as streams in dry land.

Those who are sowing in tears

will sing when they reap.

*Those who are sowing in tears will sing when they reap.*

They go out, they go out, full of tears,

carrying seed for the sowing:

they come back, they come back, full of song,

carrying their sheaves.

*Those who are sowing in tears will sing when they reap.*

**Second Reading: 2 Corinthians 4: 7-15**

We are only the earthenware jars that hold this treasure, to make it
clear that such an overwhelming power comes from God and not from us. We
are in difficulties on all sides, but never cornered; we see no answer
to our problems, but never despair; we have been persecuted, but never
deserted; knocked down, but never killed; always, wherever we may be, we
carry with us in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus,
too, may always be seen in our body. Indeed, while we are still alive,
we are consigned to our death every day, for the sake of Jesus, so that
in our mortal flesh the life of Jesus, too, may be openly shown. So
death is at work in us, but life in you.

But as we have the same spirit of faith that is mentioned in scripture
-- *I believed, and therefore I spoke* -- we too believe and therefore
we too speak, knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus to life will
raise us with Jesus in our turn, and put us by his side and you with us.
You see, all this is for your benefit, so that the more grace is
multiplied among people, the more thanksgiving there will be, to the
glory of God.

**Gospel: Matthew 20: 20-28**

**The mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus with her sons to make
a request of him, and bowed low; and he said to her, 'What is it you
want?' She said to him, 'Promise that these two sons of mine may sit one
at your right hand and the other at your left in your kingdom.' 'You do
not know what you are asking' Jesus answered. 'Can you drink the cup
that I am going to drink?' They replied, 'We can.' 'Very well,' he said
'you shall drink my cup, but as for seats at my right hand and my left,
these are not mine to grant; they belong to those to whom they have been
allotted by my Father.'**

When the other ten heard this they were indignant with the two brothers.
But Jesus called them to him and said, 'You know that among the pagans
the rulers lord it over them, and their great men make their authority
felt. This is not to happen among you. No; anyone who wants to be great
among you must be your servant, and anyone who wants to be first among
you must be your slave, just as the Son of Man came not to be served but
to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.'

News from St Michael\'s, 24th July, 2022

**Dear St Michael\'s Friends,**

Now that we\'re no longer so concerned that a pewsheet might carry
infection, here is a chance to keep in touch, and also, by email, to
update those who can\'t at present be with us. If you received this by
email and would prefer not to receive further issues, please let Eleanor
know. If you know people who haven\'t received this and might like to,
please invite them to contact her. And if you want to tell people what
is happening or what you hope to plan, put it in News From St
Michael\'s!

**A warm welcome** to Fr Derek Mottershead SSC, who is kindly
celebrating Mass for us this morning. Next Thursday and Sunday we shall
be welcoming Fr Paul Matthias as celebrant. Both Fr Derek and Fr Paul
are long-standing friends of St Michael\'s and have been most generous
in offering their help during our interregnum. Let\'s give them every
possible support.

**Fr Neil and Elizabeth** have sent a warm message of thanks for last
Sunday\'s lunch and for our parting gift to them**.** They plan to use
our cheque to buy patio furniture for their new house. We deeply
appreciate all they have both done for us during their time at St
Michael\'s, and wish them every happiness as they begin their new life
in Downham Market. **Grateful thanks** to everyone who provided the food
and help that made last Sunday an occasion to remember.

**The Funeral Mass of Irene Horton** -- who is remembered with affection
and thankfulness by the whole St Michael\'s family -- will take place at
St Michael\'s on August 22 at 11 am. Please pray for her soul, and for
Sara, Alison and their family in their bereavement.

**There\'s a Barbecue, plus Evensong and Benediction, starting at 3 pm
on Sunday July 31** at our neighbouring Resolution parish of St Michael,
Harbledown. Come along and meet people from other Resolution parishes --
friendship, encouragement and a warm welcome await! Â£2 per person, BYO
wine but soft drinks are provided. Please contact Karen Glithero (07969
404209) so that she has numbers. Could you offer a lift to a St
Michael\'s friend?

**The Richborough Family Festival at St Albans on August 13 -** everyone
is invited to share in this inspiring occasion. Solemn Mass in the
Cathedral at 12 noon will be followed by a garden party in Bishop
Norman\'s grounds -- wine provided, bring your own picnic. A chance to
experience the family love and solidarity of the Richborough group of
parishes and to be refreshed in soul and body! The train journey to St
Albans is easier than you might think -- but if driving, could you offer
a lift to a St Michael\'s friend?

**PCC and Halls:** While we have no vicar to chair our meetings, Paul
Jones has kindly agreed to be our PCC Vice-Chairman. When a parish goes
into interregnum, Churchwardens and PCC members have particular
responsibilities, and James, Paul and the whole PCC would greatly
appreciate your prayers. **We urgently need someone to take charge of
Hall bookings** -- a team of two would be ideal. Can you help?

**Pop-up Afternoon Tea, August 20,** organised by the **Mothers\'
Union** at St Peter\'s, Boughton Monchelsea. A pleasant outing and a
lovely tea for a small charge -- further details nearer the time.

**READERS\' LIST for August:** *Thank you, as always, dear readers, for
