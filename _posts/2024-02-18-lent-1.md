**FIRST SUNDAY IN LENT Hymns NEH 73, 76, 272, 74**

**FIRST READING GENESIS 9.8-17** Then God said to Noah and to his sons
with him, 'As for me, I am establishing my covenant with you and your
descendants after you, and with every living creature that is with you,
the birds, the domestic animals, and every animal of the earth with you,
as many as came out of the ark. I establish my covenant with you, that
never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and
never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth.'

God said, 'This is the sign of the covenant that I make between me and
you and every living creature that is with you, for all future
generations: I have set my bow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of
the covenant between me and the earth. When I bring clouds over the
earth and the bow is seen in the clouds, I will remember my covenant
that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and
the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh. When
the bow is in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting
covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on
the earth.'

God said to Noah, 'This is the sign of the covenant that I have
established between me and all flesh that is on the earth.'

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 25 *Response: Remember, Lord, your compassion and
love***

To you, O [Lord]{.smallcaps}, I lift up my soul; O my God, in you I
trust;

let me not be put to shame; let not my enemies triumph over me.

Let none who look to you be put to shame,

but let the treacherous be shamed and frustrated. ***R***

Make me to know your ways, O [Lord]{.smallcaps}, and teach me your
paths.

Lead me in your truth and teach me,

for you are the God of my salvation; for you have I hoped all the day
long. ***R***

Remember, [Lord]{.smallcaps}, your compassion and love, for they are
from everlasting.

Remember not the sins of my youth or my transgressions,

but think of me in your goodness, O [Lord]{.smallcaps}, according to
your steadfast love. ***R***

Gracious and upright is the [Lord]{.smallcaps}; therefore shall he teach
sinners in the way.

He will guide the humble in doing right and teach his way to the lowly.
***R***

**SECOND READING 1PETER 3.18-22** For Christ also suffered for sins once
for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to
God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in
which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, who
in former times did not obey, when God waited patiently in the days of
Noah, during the building of the ark, in which a few, that is, eight
people, were saved through water.

And baptism, which this pre-figured, now saves you -- not as a removal
of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a good conscience,
through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who has gone into heaven and
is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers made
subject to him.

**GOSPEL MARK 1. 9-15** In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was
coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit
descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, 'You are my
Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.'

And the Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. He was in
the wilderness for forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the
wild beasts; and the angels waited on him.

Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good
news of God, and saying, 'The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God
has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.'
