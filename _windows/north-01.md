“He drove them out”. The disobedient Adam and Eve are expelled from Paradise by an angel whose robe, curiously, seems to be inscribed “Alleluia” (Praise the Lord)! In most illustrations of this story the angel is shown in the garden gateway with the flaming sword mentioned in Genesis 3, 24, but here he has no sword. Perhaps the “Alleluia” is meant to remind the viewer that only through the fall of the human race could its redemption by Christ have taken place. Notice how Adam and Eve (dressed in animal skins) are stepping, barefoot, from a place of grass and flowers into a place of thorns. Unusually and poignantly, the artist shows the serpent travelling, now “on his belly”, out into the world alongside them (Genesis 3).
