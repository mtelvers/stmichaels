# FIRST READING (1 Kings 8: 22-30)

## A reading from the first book of Kings.

Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all
the assembly of Israel, and spread out his hands to heaven. He said,
'O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you in heaven above or on
earth beneath, keeping covenant and steadfast love for your servants who
walk before you with all their heart, the covenant that you kept for
your servant my father David as you declared to him; you promised with
your mouth and have this day fulfilled with your hand. Therefore,
O Lord, God of Israel, keep for your servant my father David that which
you promised him, saying, "There shall never fail you a successor before
me to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your children look to their
way, to walk before me as you have walked before me." Therefore, O God
of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you promised to your
servant my father David.

'But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Even heaven and the highest
heaven cannot contain you, much less this house that I have built! Have
regard to your servant's prayer and his plea, O Lord my God, heeding the
cry and the prayer that your servant prays to you today; that your eyes
may be open night and day towards this house, the place of which you
said, "My name shall be there", that you may heed the prayer that your
servant prays towards this place. Hear the plea of your servant and of
your people Israel when they pray towards this place; O hear in heaven
your dwelling-place; heed and forgive.

# SECOND READING (1 Peter 2: 1-10)

## A reading from the first letter of Peter.

Rid yourselves, therefore, of all malice, and all guile, insincerity,
envy, and all slander. Like newborn infants, long for the pure,
spiritual milk, so that by it you may grow into salvation--- if indeed
you have tasted that the Lord is good.

Come to him, a living stone, though rejected by mortals yet chosen and
precious in God's sight, and like living stones, let yourselves be
built into a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer
spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. 

For it stands in scripture: 'See, I am laying in Zion a stone, a
cornerstone chosen and precious; and whoever believes in him will not be
put to shame.'

To you then who believe, he is precious; but for those who do not
believe, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the very head
of the corner', and 'A stone that makes them stumble, and a rock that
makes them fall.'

They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.

But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God's own
people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called
you out of darkness into his marvellous light.

Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had
not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 2: 13-22)

The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. In
the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, and the
money-changers seated at their tables. Making a whip of cords, he drove
all of them out of the temple, both the sheep and the cattle. He also
poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their
tables. He told those who were selling the doves, 'Take these things out
of here! Stop making my Father's house a market-place!' His disciples
remembered that it was written, 'Zeal for your house will consume
me.' The Jews then said to him, 'What sign can you show us for doing
this?' Jesus answered them, 'Destroy this temple, and in three days I
will raise it up.' The Jews then said, 'This temple has been under
construction for forty-six years, and will you raise it up in three
days?' But he was speaking of the temple of his body. After he was
raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this;
and they believed the scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
