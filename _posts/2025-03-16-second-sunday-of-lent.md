# COLLECT

Almighty God, you show to those who are in error the light of your
truth, that they may return to the way of righteousness: grant to all
those who are admitted into the fellowship of Christ's religion, that
they may reject those things that are contrary to their profession,
and follow all such things as are agreeable to the same; through our
Lord Jesus Christ, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of
the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Genesis 5: 1-12, 17-18)

## A reading from the book of Genesis.

After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, 'Do
not be afraid, Abram, I am your shield; your reward shall be very
great.' But Abram said, 'O Lord God, what will you give me, for I
continue childless, and the heir of my house is Eliezer of
Damascus?' And Abram said, 'You have given me no offspring, and so a
slave born in my house is to be my heir.' But the word of the Lord came
to him, 'This man shall not be your heir; no one but your very own issue
shall be your heir.' He brought him outside and said, 'Look towards
heaven and count the stars, if you are able to count them.' Then he said
to him, 'So shall your descendants be.' And he believed the Lord; and
the Lord reckoned it to him as righteousness.

Then he said to him, 'I am the Lord who brought you from Ur of the
Chaldeans, to give you this land to possess.' But he said, 'O Lord God,
how am I to know that I shall possess it?' He said to him, 'Bring me a
heifer three years old, a female goat three years old, a ram three years
old, a turtle-dove, and a young pigeon.' He brought him all these and
cut them in two, laying each half over against the other; but he did not
cut the birds in two. And when birds of prey came down on the carcasses,
Abram drove them away.

As the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a deep and
terrifying darkness descended upon him.

When the sun had gone down and it was dark, a smoking fire-pot and a
flaming torch passed between these pieces. On that day the Lord made a
covenant with Abram, saying, 'To your descendants I give this land, from
the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.

# SECOND READING (Philippians 3:17 -- 4:1)

## A reading from the letter of Paul to the Philippians.

Brothers and sisters, join in imitating me, and observe those who live
according to the example you have in us. For many live as enemies of the
cross of Christ; I have often told you of them, and now I tell you even
with tears. Their end is destruction; their god is the belly; and their
glory is in their shame; their minds are set on earthly things. 

But our citizenship is in heaven, and it is from there that we are
expecting a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ. He will transform the body
of our humiliation so that it may be conformed to the body of his
glory, by the power that also enables him to make all things subject to
himself. Therefore, my brothers and sisters, whom I love and long for,
my joy and crown, stand firm in the Lord in this way, my beloved.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 13: 31-end)

At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, 'Get away from
here, for Herod wants to kill you.' He said to them, 'Go and tell that
fox for me, "Listen, I am casting out demons and performing cures today
and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish my work. Yet today,
tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible
for a prophet to be killed away from Jerusalem." Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it!
How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen
gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing! See, your
house is left to you. And I tell you, you will not see me until the time
comes when you say, "Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the
Lord." '
