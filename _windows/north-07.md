“The angel of the Lord stood by the threshing floor of Ornan.” Because King David (crowned, on the left) has displeased God, a destroying angel is smiting the land with sickness, which is now threatening Jerusalem (visible in the distance). David sees the angel with a drawn sword, standing near Ornan’s threshing floor, and there the repentant king offers sacrifice and the angel sheaths his sword. The other characters here are Ornan (on the right) and a shadowy figure behind David – presumably Gad, David’s seer (1 Chronicles 21).
