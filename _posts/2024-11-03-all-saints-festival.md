# FIRST READING (Isaiah 25: 6-9)

## A reading from the Prophet Isaiah.

On this mountain the Lord of hosts will make for all peoples a feast
of rich food, a feast of well-matured wines, of rich food filled with
marrow, of well-matured wines strained clear.  And he will destroy on
this mountain the shroud that is cast over all peoples, the sheet that
is spread over all nations; he will swallow up death for ever.  Then the
Lord God will wipe away the tears from all faces, and the disgrace of
his people he will take away from all the earth, for the Lord has spoken.

It will be said on that day, Lo, this is our God; we have waited for
him, so that he might save us. This is the Lord for whom we have waited;
let us be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 24)

## Response: We seek your face O Lord.

1\. Who shall ascend the hill of the Lord?\
And who shall stand in his holy place?\
Those who have clean hands and a pure heart,\
who do not seek after evil and falsehood. ***R.***

2\. They shall receive blessings from the Lord\
And vindication from the God of their salvation.\
Such are those who seek the Lord\
who seek the face of the God of Jacob. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Revelation 7: 9-14)

## A reading from the Revelation to St John the Divine.

After this I looked, and there was a great multitude that no one could
count, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages,
standing before the throne and before the Lamb, robed in white, with
palm branches in their hands. They cried out in a loud voice, saying,
'Salvation belongs to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the
Lamb!'

And all the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the
four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne
and worshipped God, singing, 'Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and
thanksgiving and honour and power and might be to our God for ever and
ever! Amen.'

Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, 'Who are these, robed in
white, and where have they come from?' I said to him, 'Sir, you are the
one that knows.' Then he said to me, 'These are they who have come out
of the great ordeal; they have washed their robes and made them white in
the blood of the Lamb.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 9: 18-27)

Once when Jesus was praying alone, with only the disciples near him, he
asked them, 'Who do the crowds say that I am?' They answered, 'John the
Baptist; but others, Elijah; and still others, that one of the ancient
prophets has arisen.' He said to them, 'But who do you say that I am?'
Peter answered, 'The Messiah of God.'

He sternly ordered and commanded them not to tell anyone, saying, 'The
Son of Man must undergo great suffering, and be rejected by the elders,
chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be
raised.'

Then he said to them all, 'If any want to become my followers, let them
deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me. For those
who want to save their life will lose it, and those who lose their life
for my sake will save it. What does it profit them if they gain the
whole world, but lose or forfeit themselves? Those who are ashamed of me
and of my words, of them the Son of Man will be ashamed when he comes in
his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. But truly
I tell you, there are some standing here who will not taste death before
they see the kingdom of God.'
