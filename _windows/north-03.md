“’Abraham!’ and he said, ‘Here am I.’” A few years afterwards, Abraham is tested when God commands him to sacrifice Isaac as a burnt offering, despite having earlier told him that He had a particular promise and plan for Isaac’s descendants. At the moment when Abraham has drawn the knife to slay his son, the angel calls to him and tells him not to touch Isaac – here the artist shows the angel actually grabbing Abraham’s arm to stop him. Abraham then sees a ram entangled in a thicket, and sacrifices the ram instead. Note the portable fire-pot on the right. Abraham here is surrounded by stars – probably a reminder that later in the same chapter, God promises to Abraham descendants as numerous “as the stars of heaven” (Genesis 22).
