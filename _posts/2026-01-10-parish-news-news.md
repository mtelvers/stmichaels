Do please join us after Mass for Tea, Coffee and Cake in the Vestry Hall - - just ask if you don’t know the way!

Services this week: Thursday Said Mass 10.30am; Next Sunday Sung Mass 10.30am.

A new year raffle!
A handsome hamper from our Christmas Fayre raffle, sadly unclaimed despite our best efforts, will be re-raffled after
Mass this Sunday. £1 for five tickets.

Medical supplies for Ukraine?
If you are having a new year clear-out, could it extend to your medicine cupboard? Even recently out-of-date
medicines will be welcomed by Simon, who lives locally, is qualified to sort such things appropriately, and can send
them on to Ukraine. We all know that unused medicines can end up in landfill, even if we do remember to return them
to the chemist. Could this be the time we find something better to do with them? A box will be at the back of church
for the next 2 weeks. Any questions to Eleanor.

Christmas Collections: These totalled £308.50, which will be split equally between the local charity “Growing
Hope Maidstone” (which supports the families of young people with neurodivergent needs and mental health issues)
and the international medical charity MSF (which is continuing to work, amongst other places, in Gaza where it
supports 1 in 5 of all hospital beds working across six hospitals, assists 1 in 3 births, and supplies 500,000 people with
clean water. In 2025 in Gaza it treated 100,000 trauma patients and performed nearly 23,000 operations). Thank you
to all who supported our Christmas Charities.

Our Epiphany Collection of groceries and toiletries has been gratefully received by Maidstone Homeless Care. They,
and the adjacent homeless shelter, would also be grateful for any unwanted clothes especially in this cold weather – if
you have anything hidden in a wardrobe you no longer need either take it along to their premises in Knightrider Street,
or let me know and I can deliver to them.

For our prayers: For our Parish and congregation, especially those who have come to church for the first time in
recent months, that they will feel welcome and find a glimpse of the love of God in our worship and fellowship. For
Bishop Luke and for all clergy and parishes under his care. For the PCC meeting on Thursday. For the leaders of the
nations, that they would use their power and influence for the common good, for the preservation of international law,
and for the well-being of their own citizens, rich and poor, strong and weak. For a resurgence in the values of truth,
justice and compassion. For all refugees and those fleeing persecution, and those living long term in refugee camps.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran,
David Green, Norman Farrington, Jacqui Barlow and Joe.

We pray for the recently departed, and among them Trevor Gatehouse. We remember those who have faithfully
served God in this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Bertha
Ward, Dorothy Tester, Lilian Agnes Rootes, Leslie Lott, Joyce Barber, Joyce Payne, Louise Wollen, Ivy Parry, Stan
Penney, Lily Chandler, Hazel Warriner.
