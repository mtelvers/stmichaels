# FIRST READING (Isaiah 60: 1-6)

## A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

Arise, shine; for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord has
risen upon you.  For darkness shall cover the earth, and thick darkness
the peoples; but the Lord will arise upon you, and his glory will appear
over you.  Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness
of your dawn.

Lift up your eyes and look around; they all gather together, they come
to you; your sons shall come from far away, and your daughters shall be
carried on their nurses' arms. Then you shall see and be radiant; your
heart shall thrill and rejoice, because the abundance of the sea shall
be brought to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.

A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and
Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring gold and
frankincense, and shall proclaim the praise of the Lord.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 72)

## Response: All nations shall fall prostrate before you, O Lord.

1\. The kings of Tarshish shall pay him tribute.\
The kings of Sheba and Seba shall bring him gifts.\
Before him all kings shall fall prostrate\
and all nations shall serve him. ***R.***

2\. For he shall save the poor when they cry\
and the needy who are helpless.\
He will have pity on the weak\
and save the lives of the poor. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Ephesians 3: 1-12)

## A reading from the letter of St Paul to the Ephesians.

This is the reason that I Paul am a prisoner for Christ Jesus for the
sake of you Gentiles--- for surely you have already heard of the
commission of God's grace that was given to me for you, and how the
mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I wrote above in a few
words, a reading of which will enable you to perceive my understanding
of the mystery of Christ. In former generations this mystery was not
made known to humankind, as it has now been revealed to his holy
apostles and prophets by the Spirit: that is, the Gentiles have become
fellow-heirs, members of the same body, and sharers in the promise in
Christ Jesus through the gospel.

Of this gospel I have become a servant according to the gift of God's
grace that was given to me by the working of his power. Although I am
the very least of all the saints, this grace was given to me to bring to
the Gentiles the news of the boundless riches of Christ, and to make
everyone see what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who
created all things; so that through the church the wisdom of God in its
rich variety might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in
the heavenly places. This was in accordance with the eternal purpose
that he has carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have access
to God in boldness and confidence through faith in him.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Matthew 2: 1-12)

In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea,
wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, 'Where is the child
who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its
rising, and have come to pay him homage.' When King Herod heard this,
he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him; and calling together all
the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where
the Messiah was to be born. They told him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea; for
so it has been written by the prophet: "And you, Bethlehem, in the land
of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you
shall come a ruler who is to shepherd my people Israel." '

Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the
exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem,
saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child; and when you have found
him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.' When they
had heard the king, they set out; and there, ahead of them, went the
star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place
where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were
overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with
Mary his mother; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening
their treasure-chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and
myrrh. And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they
left for their own country by another road.
