Eternal God, who made this most holy night to shine with the brightness
of your one true light: bring us, who have known the revelation of that
light on earth, to see the radiance of your heavenly glory; through
Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with you, in
the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever.  Amen.

# FIRST READING (Isaiah 9: 2-7)

## A reading from the book of the prophet Isaiah.

The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light;
those who lived in a land of deep darkness - on them light has shined.
You have multiplied the nation, you have increased its joy; they rejoice
before you as with joy at the harvest, as people exult when dividing
plunder. For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their
shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of
Midian. For all the boots of the tramping warriors and all the garments
rolled in blood shall be burned as fuel for the fire.

For a child has been born for us, a son given to us; authority rests
upon his shoulders; and he is named Wonderful Counsellor, Mighty God,
Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

His authority shall grow continually, and there shall be endless peace
for the throne of David and his kingdom.

He will establish and uphold it with justice and with righteousness from
this time onwards and for evermore.

The zeal of the Lord of hosts will do this.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 96)

## Response: This night our Saviour is born for us.

1.\ Sing a new song to the Lord,\
sing to the Lord all the earth.\
Sing to the Lord and bless His name;\
proclaim his help day by day. ***R.***

2\. Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad,\
tell the nations his glory.\
With justice he will rule the world,\
he will judge the peoples with his truth. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Titus 2: 11-14)

## A reading from the letter of Paul to Titus.

For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all, training
us to renounce impiety and worldly passions, and in the present age to
live lives that are self-controlled, upright, and godly, while we wait
for the blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of our great God
and Saviour, Jesus Christ. He it is who gave himself for us that he
might redeem us from all iniquity and purify for himself a people of his
own who are zealous for good deeds.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 2: 1-20)

In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world
should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken
while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be
registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to
Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended
from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary,
to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were
there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to
her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a
manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. In that region
there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their
flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the
glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the
angel said to them, 'Do not be afraid; for see---I am bringing you good
news of great joy for all the people: to you is born this day in the
city of David a Saviour, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a
sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying
in a manger.' And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly host, praising God and saying, 'Glory to God in the highest
heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favours!'

When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said
to one another, 'Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has
taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.' So they went with
haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When
they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this
child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told
them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her
heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they
had heard and seen, as it had been told them.
