When St Michael’s was consecrated in 1876, it had no stained glass, and as late as the previous year there had been a strong suggestion that the new church should be dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. It is to the final decision in favour of St Michael and All Angels – backed by the generous benefactor Frederick Scudamore of the Manor House on the opposite side of Tonbridge Road – that we owe our programme of angel windows in the north and south aisles, which is unusual both in its overall conception and in many of its details.

The first windows you see on entering the church are, however, those of the **baptistery** – the first ones to be installed (1880),  paid for by the collections at children’s services. The subjects (Noah’s ark, the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, the Baptism of Christ and His ministry to children) are all, for Christians, linked to the sacrament of baptism, by which those in search of salvation “enter the Church” in its fullest sense.

On coming into the body of the church, the eye is caught (particularly in the morning) by the **east** **window**, presented by Scudamore and installed in 1880. This and the two angel windows in the chancel are by the eminent Victorian firm of Heaton, Butler and Bayne, who often worked in association with Arthur Blomfield, the architect who designed St Michael’s. This window was inspired by Matthew 25, 31: “When the Son of Man shall come in his glory and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory…” The next few verses warn of the last judgement, and this window, besides the vision of Christ enthroned and the multitude of angels surrounding Him, includes motifs indicating that the judgement is just about to begin: two angels are sounding trumpets, while in the foreground the Archangel Michael holds the scales in which he was traditionally imagined weighing souls on judgement day. Above is an Agnus Dei, symbol of the risen Christ, sacrificed and triumphant.

The **angel windows of the two side aisles** were planned on the basis that the north side, with its more subdued light, should be devoted to Old Testament angels, and the south side, which receives the full blaze of the sun, to New Testament ones – just as, in Christian thought, the light given by God to the Jewish people in Old Testament times pointed forward to the appearance of Christ as the Sun of Righteousness. In the Old Testament we often meet the expression “the Angel of the Lord”, the idea being that the angel figure is frequently a manifestation of the immediate presence of God – hence those who encounter him are surprised to find themselves still alive. In the New Testament the emphasis is generally more on the idea of an angel as a messenger (which is what the Greek word angelos means) bringing good news, or comfort, from God to human beings.

Like those of the baptistery, this group of windows, – installed between 1882 and 1890, the Old Testament ones preceding the New – were commissioned from Hardman & Co. of Birmingham, and were probably designed by, or under,  John Hardman Powell, son-in-law of Augustus Pugin.  In places where we might expect more movement, they sometimes seem rather static, but they are remarkable (with occasional exceptions)  for their faithfulness to the text of the Bible.

Both series are, in narrative terms, in chronological order going from west to east (towards the rising sun,  the altar and the last judgement).

Starting at the west end of the **south aisle** to begin the sequence of New Testament angels. In fact these were executed and installed in the reverse of the narrative order – again an indication that the sequence was planned in advance in its totality. These too are all by Hardman & Co.  You will first notice the **west window of the aisle**, presented in memory of the first vicar of St Michael’s, showing the war in heaven (Revelation 12) in which Michael and his angels cast out the devil and his angels. The portrayal has its limitations, but the effect of the colour when the afternoon sun catches it can be spectacular.

Make your way into the **chancel** and you will see two other angel windows not easily visible from the nave. Installed in 1881, they show the archangels Michael (on the south side),  and Gabriel and Raphael (on the north). The latter two-light window was given in memory of the wholesale grocer Charles Arkcoll,; St Michael was paid for by the church’s Stained Glass Window Association, which also financed the Adam and Eve window in the north aisle.

The windows in the small **Ascension Chapel** on the north side of the church are a less coherent group. The one on the north side of the altar is said to represent the healing of the woman with the issue of blood (Mark 5), but if so, it seems, judging from its garden setting,  to have been adapted with minimal alteration from a design for the much more usual subject of the meeting of Mary Magdalene with the risen Christ – “Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended”. The corresponding window on the south side shows a child presenting a bunch of flowers to Christ and recalls His words “Of such is the Kingdom of God.” In the trefoil at the top of this window we see “a pelican in her piety” – a symbol of Christ commonly used in medieval art because it was once believed that the mother pelican gave life to her brood by wounding her breast and feeding them with her own blood, just as Christ poured out His blood to give life to the world.

The large window on the north side of the chapel, showing the ascended Christ as priest and king, was unveiled in 1921. The figure of Christ is flanked by those of St George, patron saint of England, and St Alban, honoured as the first British martyr, each bearing his own banner. The wading birds in the bottom right-hand corner of the St Alban light may refer to the legend that a river parted its waters for St Alban on his way to execution. After the end of World War I, there was much discussion about whether a war memorial should be placed in the grounds of St Michael’s, but the final decision was to install this window in memory of the fallen from this parish. A plate at the entrance to the chapel bears their names.

As you go back down the church, enjoy the lofty twin **west windows**, designed by Heaton, Butler & Bayne and presented in 1898 by the widow of Lewis Davis Wigan of Oakwood House. They depict four miracle stories related in the gospels: the stilling of the storm and the marriage at Cana (Mark 4, John 2) on the north, and blind Bartimaeus and the man with the palsy (Mark 10, Matthew 9) on the south.
