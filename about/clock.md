The turret clock at St Michaels' was manufactured by Thomas Cooke of York.  The flat-bed design format is similar to "Big Ben", though smaller and without quarterly chimes.  The escapement here is a single-five-legged version.  The clock was installed in 1877 and the mendulum set in motion in April of that year.  The price paid for the complete turret clock, including installation, was Â£277.

Pam dand Peter Wotton have written an excellent book, 'The Kent Turret Clocks of Thomas Cooke of York', which includes a chapter on the clock at St Michael & All Angels.  ISBN 1 85072 311 7
