The only Ronald Smith who served in WW1 is from Maidenhead. This Rowland Smith was born and lived in Maidstone, so may be his name was not written clearly and he should be on our Board instead of Ronald. This could be the Ronald Smith recorded on our Board with his name written unclearly and so recorded incorrectly as Ronald instead of Rowland.
