# FOR OUR PRAYERS:

We give thanks for a most enjoyable and rewarding Parish pilgrimage to Walsingham last week.

Please pray for Zoe Lee, Andy Brooks and Mark Beresford as they are Confirmed this Sunday morning by Bishop Luke.

Please pray for Bishop Luke and for all parishes and clergy under his care.

Please pray for the people of Gaza and the Holy Land, for a cessation of war and violence on all sides, for the safe return of all hostages, and for the resumption of meaningful supplies of food and medical aid to the people of Gaza. We pray for the Diocese of Jerusalem, including the restoring of medical facilities and the buildings of the Al Ahli Anglican Hospital in Gaza.

Please pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington and Fr Derek Mottershead.

Please pray for the recently departed, including Beryl Haigh and Trevor Joseph. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year's mind occurs this week: Marjorie Dray, Brian Smith, Catherine Carmody, John Frater.
