“An angel troubled the waters.” An unusual subject: this is the pool of Bethesda at Jerusalem. Occasional periods of turbulence in the pool were attributed to the activity of an angel, and when these occurred, the pool had healing properties for a sick person who could get into it immediately. According to John’s Gospel, this was the setting of a miracle performed by Christ – independently of the angel or the pool – to heal a disabled man who had no one to help him into the water. In this window, the pool is being disturbed (note the waves), but Christ is yet to arrive and the disabled man must be among the waiting figures in the foreground. Sheep are visible in the background; the evangelist says that the pool is “by the sheep market” (John 5).
