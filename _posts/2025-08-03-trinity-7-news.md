This week the Church keeps the Feast of the Transfiguration on 6th August; we shall keep the Feast at our morning

PAUL JONES. It is with great sadness that I pass on news of the death of Paul Jones, a much-loved member of our
congregation. He died peacefully at home on Friday morning after two years with brain cancer. Please pray for him,
and for Pius and all Paul’s close family and friends at this sad time. May Paul rest in peace and rise in glory, and may
the Blessed Virgin Mary, St Michael and all the Saints pray for him.

NEXT SATURDAY is our ORGAN RECITAL followed by AFTERNOON TEA AND CAKES: Saturday 9th
August starting at 2.30pm.
The Recital will be given by Levente Vas, Organ Scholar at St Hughs College Oxford. Levente is a ‘local boy’ and in
2024 he was a winner at the Kent County Organist’s Association competition, and he studies organ with Francois
Cloete and Jacob Collins. Collection for our organ fund.
Do please spread the word around any of your friends and neighbours who might support this, and aim to come
yourself too. I hope this will be the first of many such events (we also have a recital planned as part of Heritage
Weekend).

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for moves towards peace in Gaza, the wider Middle East, Ukraine, Sudan and other
places of conflict. We pray for the mission and ministry of the Church, Bishop Luke and all parishes and clergy under
his care, and especially for the Society churches in Folkestone, Deal and Ramsgate that faithful Priests would be found
to serve these respective parishes. We pray for our Ministry of Welcome at St Michael’s, for all those who welcome at
the church door, those who provide coffee and refreshments, those who keep the church clean, tidy and welcoming,
and for all of us – that we may be a truly welcoming congregation.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed, especially Paul Jones. We remember those who have faithfully served God in
this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Kenneth Jordan,
Anthony Bloom (Bp), Mollie Mason.
