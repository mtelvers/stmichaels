**2nd SUNDAY OF EPIPHANY Hymns 55, 50, 57, 393**

  --------------- -----------------
  First reading   Isaiah 49:3,5-6
  --------------- -----------------

The Lord said to me, 'You are my servant, Israel, in whom I shall be
glorified';

I was honoured in the eyes of the Lord, my God was my strength.

And now the Lord has spoken, he who formed me in the womb to be his
servant,

to bring Jacob back to him, to gather Israel to him:

'It is not enough for you to be my servant,

to restore the tribes of Jacob and bring back the survivors of Israel;

I will make you the light of the nations so that my salvation may reach
to the ends of the earth.'

  ------------------------------------------
  Responsorial Psalm Psalm 39(40):2,4,7-10
  ------------------------------------------

***Response: Here I am, Lord! I come to do your will.***

I waited, I waited for the Lord, and he stooped down to me; he heard my
cry.

He put a new song into my mouth, praise of our God.

***Here I am, Lord! I come to do your will**.*

You do not ask for sacrifice and offerings, but an open ear.

You do not ask for holocaust and victim. Instead, here am I.

***Here I am, Lord! I come to do your will.***

In the scroll of the book it stands written that I should do your will.

My God, I delight in your law in the depth of my heart.

***Here I am, Lord! I come to do your will.***

Your justice I have proclaimed in the great assembly.

My lips I have not sealed; you know it, O Lord.

***Here I am, Lord! I come to do your will.***

  Second reading 1 Corinthians 1:1-3
  ------------------------------------

I, Paul, appointed by God to be an apostle, together with brother
Sosthenes, send greetings to the church of God in Corinth, to the holy
people of Jesus Christ, who are called to take their place among all the
saints everywhere who pray to our Lord Jesus Christ; for he is their
Lord no less than ours. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
send you grace and peace.

  Gospel   John 1:29-34
  -------- --------------

Seeing Jesus coming towards him, John said, 'Look, there is the lamb of
God that takes away the sin of the world. This is the one I spoke of
when I said: A man is coming after me who ranks before me because he
existed before me. I did not know him myself, and yet it was to reveal
him to Israel that I came baptising with water.' John also declared, 'I
saw the Spirit coming down on him from heaven like a dove and resting on
him. I did not know him myself, but he who sent me to baptise with water
had said to me, "The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and rest
is the one who is going to baptise with the Holy Spirit." Yes, I have
seen and I am the witness that he is the Chosen One of God.'
