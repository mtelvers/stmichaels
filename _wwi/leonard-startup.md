‘heenlistedat guildford in surrey… leonard was one of a large number of men of the battalion who were killed that day.’ ‘the battalion’s war diaries for 3rd may 1917 record the following information: A few minutes after ZERO, the enemy put a heavy barrage on the positions occupied by the Battalion,and the leading Companies advanced to try and get in front of it. On reaching the front line it was found that the rear wave of the leading Battalion had not yet left, on their leaving, so the leading two Companies of their Battalion advanced with them but owing to the heavy fire it was found impossible to do so, and after several attempts to, it was decided to dig in and improve our original front line. During the attack the Battalion casualties amounted to 7 officers and about 110 other ranks.’
