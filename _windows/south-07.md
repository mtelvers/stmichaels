“There appeared an angel strengthening him.” Knowing that He is soon to be put to death, Christ, accompanied by his disciples Peter, James and John, has gone to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray on the night of His betrayal and arrest. The disciples are unable to stay awake, and the kneeling Christ is supported by an angel as He prays in agony that if possible the cup may pass away – but that God’s will may be done (Luke 22).
