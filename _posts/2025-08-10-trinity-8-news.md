FOR OUR PRAYERS: The situation in Gaza. For the release of hostages; for restraint in military operations that
harm innocent civilians; for the supply of food, clean water and medical aid; and for a peace process that will lead to a
long term solution and the building of trust. For church musicians, and for our own organist and choir; and for our
bellringers.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed, especially Paul Jones. We remember those who have faithfully served God in
this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Doreen Dukes, Arthur
