# COLLECT

Most merciful God, who by the death and resurrection of
your Son Jesus Christ delivered and saved the world: grant that by faith
in him who suffered on the cross we may triumph in the power of his
victory;

through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with
you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Isaiah 43: 16-21)

## A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

Thus says the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, a path in the mighty
waters, who brings out chariot and horse, army and warrior; they lie
down, they cannot rise, they are extinguished, quenched like a wick:\
Do not remember the former things, or consider the things of old. I am
about to do a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it?\
I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert. The wild
animals will honour me, the jackals and the ostriches; for I give water
in the wilderness, rivers in the desert, to give drink to my chosen
people, the people whom I formed for myself so that they might declare
my praise.

#RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Psalm 126)

## Response: They will return with joy, bearing their sheaves with them.

1\. When the Lord brought back the exiles of Sion,\
we thought we were dreaming!\
Then was our mouth filled with laughter,\
on our tongues were songs of joy! ***R.***

2\. Bring back our exiles, O Lord,\
as streams breaking out in the desert.\
Those who sow in tears\
will return with joy,\
bearing their sheaves with them. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Philippians 3: 4-14)

## A reading from the letter of Paul to the Philippians.

If anyone else has reason to be confident in the flesh, I have
more: circumcised on the eighth day, a member of the people of Israel,
of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew born of Hebrews; as to the law, a
Pharisee; as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness
under the law, blameless.

Yet whatever gains I had, these I have come to regard as loss because of
Christ. More than that, I regard everything as loss because of the
surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have
suffered the loss of all things, and I regard them as rubbish, in order
that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness
of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through faith in
Christ, the righteousness from God based on faith. I want to know
Christ and the power of his resurrection and the sharing of his
sufferings by becoming like him in his death, if somehow I may attain
the resurrection from the dead.

Not that I have already obtained this or have already reached the
goal; but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me
his own. Beloved, I do not consider that I have made it my own; but this
one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to
what lies ahead, I press on towards the goal for the prize of the
heavenly call of God in Christ Jesus.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 12: 1-8)

Six days before the Passover Jesus came to Bethany, the home of Lazarus,
whom he had raised from the dead. There they gave a dinner for him.
Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him. Mary
took a pound of costly perfume made of pure nard, anointed Jesus' feet,
and wiped them with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance of
the perfume. But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was
about to betray him), said, 'Why was this perfume not sold for three
hundred denarii and the money given to the poor?' (He said this not
because he cared about the poor, but because he was a thief; he kept the
common purse and used to steal what was put into it.) Jesus said, 'Leave
her alone. She bought it so that she might keep it for the day of my
burial. You always have the poor with you, but you do not always have
me.'
