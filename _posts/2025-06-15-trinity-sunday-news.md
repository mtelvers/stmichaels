A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
This coming week the Church celebrates Corpus Christi; we shall keep Corpus Christi next Sunday morning,
with a Sung Mass, Procession and Benediction. Thursday will also be a Mass for Corpus Christi.

What is Corpus Christi? – The Festival where we give thanks for the Institution of the Eucharist, the Mass, wherein
we encounter Christ in Word and Sacrament; for Jesus’ real presence with us in the Sacrament of the Altar; and for all
the Blessings we receive from Him as we kneel before him in homage and prayer to receive His Body and His Blood.

Come and worship with joy, as part of Jesus’ family, the Church.

St Michael’s Church Summer Fete - Saturday 5th July. There is a box near the entrance to the Ascension chapel
for donations for the various stalls and activities – especially prizes for the Tombola and Raffle. If you can contribute
to or help with other stalls – plants and gardening, books and toys, cakes, crafts and gifts – have a word with Alison
Heywood or the stall organiser.

                               Note the date – come and enjoy – invite your friends !!

        Last year’s Christmas Market was an astounding success – let’s make it the same this Summer !!
