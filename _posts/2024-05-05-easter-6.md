**6th SUNDAY OF EASTER Hymns NEH 338, 486, 295, 103**

**FIRST READING (Acts 10.44-48)** *A reading from the Acts of the
Apostles.* While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell upon all
who heard the word. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter
were astounded that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even
on the Gentiles, for they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling
God. Then Peter said, 'Can anyone withhold the water for baptizing these
people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?' So he ordered
them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they invited him
to stay for several days.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 98**

***Response: The Lord has shown his salvation to the nations.***

1\. Sing a new song to the Lord:  
for he has worked wonders.  
His right hand and his holy arm:  
have brought salvation. **R.**

2\. The Lord has made known his salvation:  
has shown his justice to the nations.  
He has remembered his truth and love:  
for the house of Israel. **R.**

3\. All the ends of the earth have seen:  
the salvation of our God.  
Shout to the Lord all the earth:  
ring out your joy. **R.**

**SECOND READING (1 John 5.1-6)** *A reading from the first letter of
John*. Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of
God, and everyone who loves the parent loves the child. By this we know
that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his
commandments. For the love of God is this, that we obey his
commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome, for whatever is
born of God conquers the world. And this is the victory that conquers
the world, our faith. Who is it that conquers the world but the one who
believes that Jesus is the Son of God? This is the one who came by water
and blood, Jesus Christ, not with the water only but with the water and
the blood. And the Spirit is the one that testifies, for the Spirit is
the truth.

**GOSPEL John 15.9-17** As the Father has loved me, so I have loved you;
abide in my love. If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my
love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his
love. I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and
that your joy may be complete. 'This is my commandment, that you love
one another as I have loved you. No one has greater love than this, to
lay down one's life for one's friends. You are my friends if you do what
I command you. I do not call you servants any longer, because the
servant does not know what the master is doing; but I have called you
friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard
from my Father. You did not choose me but I chose you. And I appointed
you to go and bear fruit, fruit that will last, so that the Father will
give you whatever you ask him in my name. I am giving you these commands
so that you may love one another.
