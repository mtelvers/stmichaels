For our prayers: For Bishop Luke and all clergy and parishes under his care; for Josh, Eva and Martha as they
prepare for Confirmation. For the care homes in our parish, including Lukestone, The Poplars and Mont Calm – for
staff, residents, and friends and relatives of those who live there. For Archbishop-designate Sarah as she takes up the
legal position of Archbishop of Canterbury on Wednesday this week.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran,
David Green, Norman Farrington, Jacqui Barlow and Joe.

We pray for the recently departed, and among them Trevor Gatehouse. We remember those who have faithfully
served God in this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Mary
Baldock, Richard Onions, Irene Goulding.
