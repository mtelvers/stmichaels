Priest-in-Charge Fr John Ainslie ([revjohnainslie@gmail.com](mailto:revjohnainslie@gmail.com); 01628 629827)

A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
A VERY BIG ‘THANK YOU’ to everyone who contributed to our fantastic Summer Fete yesterday – for all the
preparations and planning, and for hard work on the day.

GIFT AID: If you give to St Michael’s through the envelope scheme or by direct debit and would like us to claim the
Gift Aid on your donations please complete a new Gift Aid form (available at Back of Church) and pop it into the
Box Provided (please do this even if you have completed a form in the past).

If you are a taxpayer, we can increase the amount of your donation / Sunday collection by reclaiming tax at no
cost to yourself. If this is you, and you aren’t yet a member of our regular giving scheme by envelope or bank
direct debit – do please have a chat with me. Fr John.

WALSINGHAM 2026: I have booked 12 places for our Walsingham Pilgrimage 26th – 29th May 2026. Please put
the dates in your diary NOW.

Walsingham 2025: Sue Hemmings has provided a beautiful book of photos from our pilgrimage this year – it is on
the desk at Back of Church. Do please have a look – especially if you have never been to Walsingham and want to see
more about it.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: This week we pray for our local community, and for all who live or work within the
boundaries of our Parish. For the schools of our Parish, especially St Michael’s Primary and Juniors; for the Care
Homes of our Parish; and for local GP surgeries and healthcare workers. For our local and County Councillors and
MP.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: David Parsons, Helen Bird, Christine
Strachan, Robert Hickmott, Reginald Rust, Joyce Banfield, Irene Horton.
