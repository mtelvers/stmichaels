**Feast of the Transfiguration of Our Lord (transferred)**

**First Reading: Daniel 10: 9-10, 13-14**

**As I watched:**

Thrones were set in place

and one of great age took his seat.

His robe was white as snow,

the hair of his head as pure as wool.

His throne was a blaze of flames,

its wheels were a burning fire.

A stream of fire poured out,

issuing from his presence.

A thousand thousand waited on him,

ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him.

A court was held

and the books were opened.

I gazed into the visions of the night.

And I saw, coming on the clouds of heaven,

one like a son of man.

He came to the one of great age

and was led into his presence.

On him was conferred sovereignty,

glory and kingship,

and men of all peoples, nations and languages became his servants.

His sovereignty is an eternal sovereignty

which shall never pass away,

nor will his empire ever be destroyed.

  Responsorial Psalm 97
  -----------------------

*The Lord is king, most high above all the earth.*

The Lord is king, let earth rejoice,

let all the coastlands be glad.

Cloud and darkness are his raiment;

his throne, justice and right.

*The Lord is king, most high above all the earth.*

The mountains melt like wax

before the Lord of all the earth.

The skies proclaim his justice;

all peoples see his glory.

*The Lord is king, most high above all the earth.*

For you indeed are the Lord

most high above all the earth,

exalted far above all spirits.

*The Lord is king, most high above all the earth.*

**Second Reading: IIPeter 1: 16-19**

Beloved:\
We did not follow cleverly devised myths\
when we made known to you\
the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,\
but we had been eyewitnesses of his majesty.\
For he received honour and glory from God the Father\
when that unique declaration came to him from the majestic glory,\
\"This is my Son, my beloved, with whom I am well pleased.\"\
We ourselves heard this voice come from heaven\
while we were with him on the holy mountain.\
Moreover, we possess the prophetic message that is altogether reliable.\
You will do well to be attentive to it,\
as to a lamp shining in a dark place,\
until day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.

**Gospel: Matthew 17: 1-9**\
