***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can
welcome you properly.

**April 28th is the date of our Annual Meeting.** This falls into two
parts -- the Annual Meeting for the Election of Churchwardens and the
Annual Parochial Church Meeting -- and will take place immediately after
Mass. Elections at the Parochial Church Meeting include those of Deanery
Synod members and PCC members. Are you willing to serve, or can you
encourage someone else? Nomination forms will be found at the back of
the church; please hand completed forms to Jonathan or Eleanor. This is
a time to take stock of the past year (some of the reports will be
circulated in advance) and to think about our visions and hopes for the
future of St Michael\'s.

**This year\'s Week of Accompanied Prayer** in Maidstone Deanery ("A
Retreat in Everyday Life") will take place at St Martin\'s Church,
Northumberland Road, from 2nd to 8th June. Information and
Application Forms from Doreen Rendell -- <djrendell@gmail.com>.
