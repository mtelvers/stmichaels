**A very warm welcome** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service so we can welcome
you properly.

**SERVICES THIS COMING WEEK:** Thursday, said Mass in Lent 10.30am. Next

**NEXT SATURDAY 22nd March - LENT QUIET MORNING 10am -- 12.30:

**OUR LENT CHARITY -- MARY'S MEALS**

Mary's Meals is a charity based in the Roman Catholic Church which
provides meals for children in school in the very poorest countries. In
this way they provide sustenance for children who otherwise would go
hungry, but in a way that also encourages children to attend school and
get an education which might lift them and their families out of
poverty. **Collections via Lent Boxes and our Lent Lunch on Sunday
16th March.**

**There are Lent Boxes and 'Tea Cups' at Back of Church -- do please
take one home if you wish, and use it for your loose change and regular
donations throughout Lent. Bring it back full on Maundy Thursday !!**

**NEW CHURCH ELECTORAL ROLL:** The box is still at back of church for
late delivery of Electoral Roll forms.

**THE PCC** meet this Thursday at 7.30pm.

**FOR OUR PRAYERS:** We pray that we would use Lent well as a time for
prayer, reading and reflection. We pray for the work of our PCC, meeting
on Thursday. We pray for our fractured world at a time of uncertainty
and crisis, especially for Ukraine and the Middle East. We pray for
children and families in poor countries of the world, and for the work
of the charity 'Mary's Meals'.

**We pray for those in need**, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis
Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn
Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Alison Heywood, Norman
Farrington, Olga Danes-Volkov, Pope Francis.

**We pray for the recently departed**. We remember those who have
faithfully served God in this Church in previous generations, and we
pray for those whose year's mind occurs this week: Arthur Tester.
