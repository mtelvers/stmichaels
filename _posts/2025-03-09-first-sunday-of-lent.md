# COLLECT

Almighty God, whose Son Jesus Christ fasted forty days in the wilderness
and was tempted as we are yet without sin: give us grace to discipline
ourselves in obedience to your Spirit; and, as you know our weakness,

so may we know your power to save; through Jesus Christ your Son our
Lord, who is alive and reigns with you,

in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Deuteronomy 26: 1-11)

## A reading from the book of Deuteronomy.

When you have come into the land that the Lord your God is giving you as
an inheritance to possess, and you possess it, and settle in it, you
shall take some of the first of all the fruit of the ground, which you
harvest from the land that the Lord your God is giving you, and you
shall put it in a basket and go to the place that the Lord your God will
choose as a dwelling for his name. You shall go to the priest who is in
office at that time, and say to him, 'Today I declare to the Lord your
God that I have come into the land that the Lord swore to our ancestors
to give us.' When the priest takes the basket from your hand and sets it
down before the altar of the Lord your God, you shall make this response
before the Lord your God: 'A wandering Aramean was my ancestor; he went
down into Egypt and lived there as an alien, few in number, and there he
became a great nation, mighty and populous. When the Egyptians treated
us harshly and afflicted us, by imposing hard labour on us, we cried to
the Lord, the God of our ancestors; the Lord heard our voice and saw our
affliction, our toil, and our oppression. The Lord brought us out of
Egypt with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, with a terrifying
display of power, and with signs and wonders; and he brought us into
this place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. So
now I bring the first of the fruit of the ground that you, O Lord, have
given me.' You shall set it down before the Lord your God and bow down
before the Lord your God. Then you, together with the Levites and the
aliens who reside among you, shall celebrate with all the bounty that
the Lord your God has given to you and to your house.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Psalm 91) 

## Response: The Lord who you trust will deliver you.

1\. You who live under the shelter of the most high,\
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,\
will say to the Lord 'my refuge and my fortress\
my God in whom I trust'. ***R.***

2\. He will deliver you from the deadly pestilence\
and under his wings you will find refuge.\
His faithfulness is a shield and buckler\
you shall not fear by day or by night. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Romans 10: 8-13)

## A reading from the letter of Paul to the Romans.

'The word is near you, on your lips and in your heart' (that is, the
word of faith that we proclaim); because if you confess with your lips
that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from
the dead, you will be saved. For one believes with the heart and so is
justified, and one confesses with the mouth and so is saved. The
scripture says, 'No one who believes in him will be put to shame.' For
there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; the same Lord is Lord of
all and is generous to all who call on him. For, 'Everyone who calls on
the name of the Lord shall be saved.'

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 4: 1-13) 

Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by
the Spirit in the wilderness, where for forty days he was tempted by the
devil. He ate nothing at all during those days, and when they were over,
he was famished. The devil said to him, 'If you are the Son of God,
command this stone to become a loaf of bread.' Jesus answered him, 'It
is written, "One does not live by bread alone." '

Then the devil led him up and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms
of the world. And the devil said to him, 'To you I will give their glory
and all this authority; for it has been given over to me, and I give it
to anyone I please. If you, then, will worship me, it will all be
yours.' Jesus answered him, 'It is written, "Worship the Lord your God,
and serve only him." '

Then the devil took him to Jerusalem, and placed him on the pinnacle of
the temple, saying to him, 'If you are the Son of God, throw yourself
down from here, for it is written, "He will command his angels
concerning you, to protect you", and "On their hands they will bear
you up, so that you will not dash your foot against a stone." '\
Jesus answered him, 'It is said, "Do not put the Lord your God to the
test." ' 

When the devil had finished every test, he departed from him until an
opportune time.
