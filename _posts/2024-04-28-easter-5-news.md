*A very warm welcome* to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us for
refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can
welcome you properly.

***Our Services in the coming week:*** Thursday -- Mass at 10.30 am;
Sunday -- Mass at 10.30 am.

**Today, please stay in church after Mass for our Annual Meeting.** This
falls into two parts -- the Annual Meeting for the Election of
Churchwardens and the Annual Parochial Church Meeting -- and will take
place in church immediately after Mass. Elections at the Parochial
Church Meeting include those of Deanery Synod members and PCC members.
Are you willing to serve, or can you encourage someone else? Do you want
to share your hopes for the future of St Michael\'s? If you need hard
copies of any of the paperwork, some are available in the narthex.

**Peggy Thresh** -- wartime aircraft mechanic, physiotherapist, wife of
distinguished plant biologist Michael, mother, grandmother and
great-grandmother of a talented family, devoted member of St Michael\'s
(particularly in the area of our music) -- died peacefully at The Grove
on the morning of April 23rd, aged 102. May she rest in peace and
arise in glory. We all have wonderful memories of Peggy, and there will
certainly be an opportunity to share them at a memorial service at St
Michael\'s -- date to be announced.
