Priest-in-Charge Fr John Ainslie ([revjohnainslie@gmail.com](mailto:revjohnainslie@gmail.com); 01628 629827)

PRAYER REQUEST SLIPS are available at the back of church if you want to request prayer for yourself, for
someone else or for a particular situation.

SERVICES THIS WEEK: Thursday Mass at 10.30am; Saturday Mass of Our Lady of Walsingham at 10.30am;
service of Holy Matrimony (Wedding) at 12.45; Next Sunday Harvest Festival Sung Mass at 10.30am.

Next Sunday is our HARVEST FESTIVAL: Please bring contributions of dried food and toiletries which will be
presented at the Altar and Blessed, before being taken to Maidstone Homeless Care. This is a great opportunity
to show our love of neighbour, as well as provide much needed assistance to those who have so much less than we do.
Pupils at our St Michael’s Infants and Junior Schools had their Harvest Festival this week, and their Harvest Offerings
are already in front of the Altar.

HERITAGE OPEN DAY / RIDE-AND-STRIDE: Well done everyone who contributed in preparations beforehand,
and on the day. Donations towards church funds on the day totalled £180. Catherine and Aston both cycled to various
churches and raised a fantastic £400 in sponsorship money !! Thank you to them, and to all who sponsored them.

CHORAL EVENSONG at All Saints Perry Street, Gravesend Sunday 5th October. Our choir will be joining with
the choir of All Saints for a traditional service of Choral Evensong at Perry Street at 5pm. All are welcome. We hope
their choir will be joining with us for our Carol Service at St Michaels’ on Sunday 21st December.

We are already planning the St Michael’s CHRISTMAS MARKET, Saturday 29th November. So it’s time to
think about what you might be able to contribute to the various stalls: Crafts and Gifts, Cakes, Books and Games,
Plants and Gardening, Raffle and Tombola. We hope that Father Christmas will once again make an appearance !!

CONFIRMATION: I will be running a Confirmation Course this Autumn for those wishing to be Confirmed – which
is an opportunity to make your commitment to God as an adult, and to begin receiving Holy Communion at Mass. If
you would like to be Confirmed, or just want to know more, do have a word with me. Fr John.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We give thanks and praise to God for St Michael and all the angels. We pray for peace in the
world, and for relief for those who are living in dark places and through dark times. We pray that our young people
would be protected from all influences towards evil, and grow up to know the peace, joy and love of the Christian
faith. We pray for Alyce Cooper and Lewis Wright, to be married at St Michaels next Saturday.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, David Green, Norman Farrington, Chris Jenkins, Bridget Humphries and Bob Humphries.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Ann Day, Valerie Brown, David Vaughan,
Gordon Harris
