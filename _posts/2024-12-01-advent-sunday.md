# COLLECT for Advent Sunday:

Almighty God, give us grace to cast away the works of darkness and to
put on the armour of light,

now in the time of this mortal life, in which your Son Jesus Christ came
to us in great humility;

that on the last day, when he shall come again in his glorious majesty
to judge the living and the dead,

we may rise to the life immortal; through him who is alive and reigns
with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,

one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Jeremiah 33: 14-16)

## A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.

The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will fulfil the
promise I made to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. In those
days and at that time I will cause a righteous Branch to spring up for
David; and he shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In
those days Judah will be saved and Jerusalem will live in safety. And
this is the name by which it will be called: 'The Lord is our
righteousness.'

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 25)

## Response: For you I wait all the day long.

1\. Make me to know your ways O Lord,\
teach me your paths and lead me in your truth.\
For you are the God of my salvation,\
for you I wait all the day long. ***R.***

2\. Good and upright is the Lord,\
he leads the humble in the ways of righteousness.\
The paths of the Lord are steadfast love and faithfulness\
for those who keep his commandments. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (1 Thessalonians 3:12 -- 4:2)

## A reading from the first letter to the Thessalonians.

May the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and
for all, just as we abound in love for you. And may he so strengthen
your hearts in holiness that you may be blameless before our God and
Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.

Finally, brothers and sisters, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus
that, as you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God
(as, in fact, you are doing), you should do so more and more. For you
know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 21: 25-36)

'There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and on the
earth distress among nations confused by the roaring of the sea and the
waves. People will faint from fear and foreboding of what is coming upon
the world, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then they will
see "the Son of Man coming in a cloud" with power and great glory. Now
when these things begin to take place, stand up and raise your heads,
because your redemption is drawing near.'

Then he told them a parable: 'Look at the fig tree and all the trees; as
soon as they sprout leaves you can see for yourselves and know that
summer is already near. So also, when you see these things taking place,
you know that the kingdom of God is near. Truly I tell you, this
generation will not pass away until all things have taken place. Heaven
and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.

'Be on guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation
and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day does not
catch you unexpectedly, like a trap. For it will come upon all who live
on the face of the whole earth. Be alert at all times, praying that you
may have the strength to escape all these things that will take place,
and to stand before the Son of Man.'
