# COLLECT

Eternal Father, who at the baptism of Jesus revealed him to be your Son,
anointing him with the Holy Spirit:

grant to us, who are born again by water and the Spirit, that we may be
faithful to our calling as your adopted children;

through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with
you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Isaiah 43: 1-7)

## A reading from the prophet Isaiah.

But now thus says the Lord, he who created you, O Jacob, he who formed
you, O Israel: Do not fear, for I have redeemed you; I have called you
by name, you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with
you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk
through fire you shall not be burned, and the flame shall not
consume you.

For I am the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Saviour. I give
Egypt as your ransom, Ethiopia and Seba in exchange for you. Because you
are precious in my sight, and honoured, and I love you, I give people in
return for you, nations in exchange for your life.

Do not fear, for I am with you; I will bring your offspring from the
east, and from the west I will gather you; I will say to the north,
'Give them up', and to the south, 'Do not withhold; bring my sons from
far away and my daughters from the end of the earth - everyone who is
called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made.'

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 29)

## Response: The Lord sits as king for ever.

1\. Give the Lord the glory of his name,\
adore the Lord in his holy court.\
The Lord's voice resounds on the waters,\
the Lord sits as king for ever. ***R.***

2\. The voice of the Lord, full of power,\
The voice of the Lord full of splendour.\
The Lord sat enthroned over the flood;\
the Lord on the immensity of the waters. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Acts 8: 14-17)

# A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.

Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the
word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. The two went down and
prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit (for as yet the
Spirit had not come upon any of them; they had only been baptized in the
name of the Lord Jesus). Then Peter and John laid their hands on them,
and they received the Holy Spirit.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 3: 15-17, 21-22)

As the people were filled with expectation, and all were questioning in
their hearts concerning John, whether he might be the Messiah, John
answered all of them by saying, 'I baptize you with water; but one who
is more powerful than I is coming; I am not worthy to untie the thong of
his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. His
winnowing-fork is in his hand, to clear his threshing-floor and to
gather the wheat into his granary; but the chaff he will burn with
unquenchable fire.'

Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been
baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit
descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from
heaven, 'You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.'
