Keep Praying Pentecost – Spirit of Love, Leading Us Out
-------------------------------------------------------

_‘Breathe on us, breath of God; fill us with life anew’_

The Changing Lives Prayer Network publishes seasonal prayers four times a year, featuring beautiful artwork by Primrose Northrop.

You are invited to pray these prayers, in unity with one another, across our diocese.

You might like to offer these prayers:

*   during your own personal prayer time
*   in your online prayer group
*   during online worship
*   at the start of online meetings
*   by praying with others over the phone, by email or text
*   at home with family and, online, with friends
*   by displaying the prayers on noticeboards and in prayer spaces

You can download our [seasonal prayer card here](https://www.canterburydiocese.org/content/pages/documents/pentecost-spirit-of-love-leading-us-out.pdf) and it can also be viewed [online](https://issuu.com/home/published/pentecost___spirit_of_love__leading_us_out) or on a smartphone or tablet, using the [Issuu App](https://issuu.com/home/published/pentecost___spirit_of_love__leading_us_out) (simply search for ‘dioceseofcanterbury’ in publishers).
