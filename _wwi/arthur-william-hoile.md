The Mention in Despatches (M.I.D.) for a serviceman is not an award of a medal, but is a commendation of an act of gallantry or service. Arthur William Hoile’s name would appear in the official report written by a Superior Officer and sent to the high command, in which is described the Soldier's gallant or meritorious action in the face of the enemy.  This despatch is published in the London Gazette newspaper of the State, which has existed since 1665. If no campaign medal is awarded, the oak leaf is worn on the left breast of the dress uniform. This would signify that Arthur William Hoile had been ‘Mentioned in Despatches’.
