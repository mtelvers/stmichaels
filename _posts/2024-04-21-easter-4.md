**FOURTH SUNDAY OF EASTER Hymns NEH 101, 351, 118, 113**

**FIRST READING Acts 4.5-12** The next day their rulers, elders, and
scribes assembled in Jerusalem, with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas,
John, and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. When
they had made the prisoners stand in their midst, they inquired, 'By
what power or by what name did you do this?' Then Peter, filled with the
Holy Spirit, said to them, 'Rulers of the people and elders, if we are
questioned today because of a good deed done to someone who was sick and
are asked how this man has been healed, let it be known to all of you,
and to all the people of Israel, that this man is standing before you in
good health by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified,
whom God raised from the dead. This Jesus is "the stone that was
rejected by you, the builders; it has become the cornerstone." There is
salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given
among mortals by which we must be saved.'

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 23 *Response: The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not
be in want.***

1 The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not be in want.

2 He makes me lie down in green pastures   
and leads me beside still waters. ***R***

3 He revives my soul   
and guides me along right pathways for his name's sake.

4 Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,  
I shall fear no evil; for you are with me;  
your rod and your staff, they comfort me. ***R***

5 You spread a table before me  
in the presence of those who trouble me;  
you have anointed my head with oil,  
and my cup is running over.

6 Surely your goodness and mercy shall follow me  
all the days of my life,  
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. ***R***

**SECOND READING 1 John 3.16-24** We know love by this, that he laid
down his life for us---and we ought to lay down our lives for one
another. How does God's love abide in anyone who has the world's goods
and sees a brother or sister in need and yet refuses help? Little
children, let us love, not in word or speech, but in truth and action.
And by this we will know that we are from the truth and will reassure
our hearts before him whenever our hearts condemn us; for God is greater
than our hearts, and he knows everything. Beloved, if our hearts do not
condemn us, we have boldness before God; and we receive from him
whatever we ask, because we obey his commandments and do what pleases
him. And this is his commandment, that we should believe in the name of
his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us.
All who obey his commandments abide in him, and he abides in them. And
by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit that he has given
us.

**GOSPEL John 10.11-18** 'I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays
down his life for the sheep. The hired hand, who is not the shepherd and
does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and
runs away---and the wolf snatches them and scatters them. The hired hand
runs away because a hired hand does not care for the sheep. I am the
good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me, just as the Father
knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep. I
have other sheep that do not belong to this fold. I must bring them
also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock, one
shepherd. For this reason the Father loves me, because I lay down my
life in order to take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it
down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to
take it up again. I have received this command from my Father.'
