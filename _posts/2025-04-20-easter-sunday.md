# COLLECT

Lord of all life and power, who through the mighty
resurrection of your Son overcame the old order of sin and death to make
all things new in him:

grant that we, being dead to sin and alive to you in Jesus Christ, may reign with him in glory;
to whom with you and the Holy Spirit be praise and honour, glory and
might, now and in all eternity. **AMEN.**

# FIRST READING (Acts 10: 34-43)

## A reading from the Acts of the Apostles.

Peter began to speak to them: 'I truly understand that God shows no
partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is
right is acceptable to him. You know the message he sent to the people
of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ---he is Lord of all. That
message spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism
that John announced: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy
Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who
were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. We are witnesses to
all that he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by
hanging him on a tree; but God raised him on the third day and allowed
him to appear, not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as
witnesses, and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the
dead. He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is
the one ordained by God as judge of the living and the dead. All the
prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives
forgiveness of sins through his name.'

# SECOND READING (1 Corinthians 15: 19-26)

## A reading from the first letter of Paul to the Corinthians.

If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all people most
to be pitied. But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the
first fruits of those who have died. 

For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of the dead
has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so all will
be made alive in Christ. But each in his own order: Christ the first
fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes the
end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has
destroyed every ruler and every authority and power. For he must reign
until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be
destroyed is death.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 20: 1-18)

Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary
Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from
the tomb. So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the
one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, 'They have taken the Lord out of
the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.' Then Peter and
the other disciple set out and went towards the tomb. The two were
running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the
tomb first. He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying
there, but he did not go in. Then Simon Peter came, following him, and
went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there, and the
cloth that had been on Jesus' head, not lying with the linen wrappings
but rolled up in a place by itself. Then the other disciple, who reached
the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed; for as yet they
did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead. Then
the disciples returned to their homes.

But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to
look into the tomb; and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the
body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the
feet. They said to her, 'Woman, why are you weeping?' She said to them,
'They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid
him.' When she had said this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing
there, but she did not know that it was Jesus. Jesus said to her,
'Woman, why are you weeping? For whom are you looking?' Supposing him to
be the gardener, she said to him, 'Sir, if you have carried him away,
tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.' Jesus said
to her, 'Mary!' She turned and said to him in Hebrew, 'Rabbouni!' (which
means Teacher). Jesus said to her, 'Do not hold on to me, because I have
not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them,
"I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
God." ' Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, 'I have seen
the Lord'; and she told them that he had said these things to her.
