The family moved to Kent soon after Georgeâ€™s birth, as the rest of the family were born there.  George was the son of George and Clara Potts. George Potts was born 1890 in Salt Lake City, Utah,USA His parents George and Clara were converted to the Mormon Faith as were many of the family by the evangelist J D McAlister. We do not know why but George and Clara returned to England prior to the 1901 census. In 1901 the family lived at 11 Hartnup Street and the family still lived there in 1911 when George was with his Regiment in India, aged 23.  The family were quite poor and their son George joined the Army in 1907. George enlisted in Maidstone. For a young man it would have meant three square meals, travel and an escape from poverty. His regiment the 4th Battalion Worcestershire were sent to Gallipoli in 1915. Sadly he lost his life during the attack on Gully Ravine, 28th of June. He was one of 21,000 lost during this campaign.
