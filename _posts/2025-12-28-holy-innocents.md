Hymns NEH 42, 29, 39, 297

# FIRST READING (Jeremiah 31: 15-17)

## A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.

Thus says the Lord: A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping. Rachel is weeping for her children; she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no more. Thus says the Lord: Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for there is a reward for your work, says the Lord: they shall come back from the land of the enemy; there is hope for your future, says the Lord: your children shall come back to their own country.

# SECOND READING (1 Cor 1: 26-29)

## A reading from the First Letter of Paul to the Church in Corinth..

Consider your own call, brothers and sisters: not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong; God chose what is low and despised in the world, things that are not, to reduce to nothing things that are, so that no one might boast in the presence of God.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM

## Response: Our help is in the name of the Lord.

1\. If it had not been the Lord on our side,\
now may Israel say,\
then they would have swallowed us up\
When our enemies attacked us. ***R.***

2\. Blessed be the Lord\
who has not given us as prey to their teeth.\
We have escaped like a bird\
from the snare of the fowlers. ***R.***



# HOLY GOSPEL (Matthew 2: 13-18)

Now after they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ‘Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.’ Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt, and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, ‘Out of Egypt I have called my son.’ When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he was infuriated, and he sent and killed all the children in and around Bethlehem who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had learned from the wise men. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken through the prophet Jeremiah: ‘A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they are no more.’
