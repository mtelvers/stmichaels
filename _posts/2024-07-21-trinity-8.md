# FIRST READING ( Jeremiah 23: 1-6)

Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!
says the Lord. Therefore, thus says the Lord, the God of Israel,
concerning the shepherds who shepherd my people: It is you who have
scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended
to them. So I will attend to you for your evil doings, says
the Lord. Then I myself will gather the remnant of my flock out of all
the lands where I have driven them, and I will bring them back to their
fold, and they shall be fruitful and multiply. I will raise up shepherds
over them who will shepherd them, and they shall not fear any longer, or
be dismayed, nor shall any be missing, says the Lord.

The days are surely coming, says the Lord, when I will raise up for
David a righteous Branch, and he shall reign as king and deal wisely,
and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days
Judah will be saved and Israel will live in safety. And this is the name
by which he will be called: 'The Lord is our righteousness.'

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (Ps 23)

Response: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

1. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.\
He makes me lie down in green pastures.\
He leads me beside still waters;\
he restores my soul. R.

2. He leads me in right paths for his names sake.\
Even though I walk through the\
darkest valley I fear no evil;\
for you are with me,\
your rod and your staff they comfort me.  R.

3. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies,\
You anoint my head with oil, and my cup overflows.\
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me\
   all the days of my life,\
and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. R.

# SECOND READING (Ephesians 2: 11-end)

So then, remember that at one time you Gentiles by birth, called 'the
uncircumcision' by those who are called 'the circumcision'---a physical
circumcision made in the flesh by human hands--- remember that you were
at that time without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of
Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and
without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far
off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace;
in his flesh he has made both groups into one and has broken down the
dividing wall, that is, the hostility between us. He has abolished the
law with its commandments and ordinances, so that he might create in
himself one new humanity in place of the two, thus making peace, and
might reconcile both groups to God in one body through the cross, thus
putting to death that hostility through it. So he came and proclaimed
peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near; for
through him both of us have access in one Spirit to the Father. So then
you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are citizens with the
saints and also members of the household of God, built upon the
foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as
the cornerstone. In him the whole structure is joined together and grows
into a holy temple in the Lord; in whom you also are built together
spiritually into a dwelling-place for God.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Mark 6: 30-34, 53-end)

The apostles gathered around Jesus, and told him all that they had done
and taught. He said to them, 'Come away to a deserted place all by
yourselves and rest a while.' For many were coming and going, and they
had no leisure even to eat. And they went away in the boat to a deserted
place by themselves. Now many saw them going and recognized them, and
they hurried there on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of
them. As he went ashore, he saw a great crowd; and he had compassion for
them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to
teach them many things.

When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored
the boat. When they got out of the boat, people at once recognized
him, and rushed about that whole region and began to bring the sick on
mats to wherever they heard he was. And wherever he went, into villages
or cities or farms, they laid the sick in the market-places, and begged
him that they might touch even the fringe of his cloak; and all who
touched it were healed.
