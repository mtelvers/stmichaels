**PALM GOSPEL Matthew 21.1-11** When they had come near Jerusalem and
had reached Bethphage, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples,
saying to them, 'Go into the village ahead of you, and immediately you
will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her; untie them and bring them
to me. If anyone says anything to you, just say this, "The Lord needs
them." And he will send them immediately.' This took place to fulfil
what had been spoken through the prophet, saying, 'Tell the daughter of
Zion, Look, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey,
and on a colt, the foal of a donkey.' The disciples went and did as
Jesus had directed them; they brought the donkey and the colt, and put
their cloaks on them, and he sat on them. 8A very large crowd spread
their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and
spread them on the road. The crowds that went ahead of him and that
followed were shouting, 'Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is the one
who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!' When
he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in turmoil, asking, 'Who is
this?' The crowds were saying, 'This is the prophet Jesus from Nazareth
in Galilee.'

**FIRST READING** **Isaiah 50.4-9a** The Lord God has given me the
tongue of a teacher, that I may know how to sustain the weary with a
word. Morning by morning he wakens--- wakens my ear to listen as those
who are taught. The Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not
rebellious, I did not turn backwards. I gave my back to those who struck
me, and my cheeks to those who pulled out the beard; I did not hide my
face from insult and spitting. The Lord God helps me; therefore I have
not been disgraced; therefore I have set my face like flint, and I know
that I shall not be put to shame; he who vindicates me is near. Who will
contend with me? Let us stand up together. Who are my adversaries? Let
them confront me. It is the Lord God who helps me; who will declare me
guilty?

**Responsorial Psalm 31. Response: My God, my God, why have you forsaken
me?**

Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am in trouble;  
my eye is consumed with sorrow, my soul and my body also.  
For my life is wasted with grief, and my years with sighing;  
my strength fails me because of my affliction, and my bones are
consumed. **R.**

I have become a reproach to all my enemies and even to my neighbours,  
an object of dread to my acquaintances; when they see me in the street
they flee from me.  
I am forgotten like one that is dead, out of mind; I have become like a
broken vessel. **R.**

For I have heard the whispering of the crowd; fear is on every side;  
they scheme together against me, and plot to take my life.  
But my trust is in you, O Lord. I have said, 'You are my God. **R.**

'My times are in your hand;  
deliver me from the hand of my enemies, and from those who persecute me.  
'Make your face to shine upon your servant, and save me for your mercy's
sake.' **R.**

**SECOND READING Philippians 2.5-11** Let the same mind be in you that
was in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not
regard equality with God as something to be exploited, but emptied
himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness. And
being found in human form, he humbled himself and became obedient to the
point of death--- even death on a cross. Therefore God also highly
exalted him and gave him the name that is above every name, so that at
the name of Jesus every knee should bend, in heaven and on earth and
under the earth, and every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is
Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

(Matthew 26:14 -- 27: 66).**
