**THIRD SUNDAY BEFORE LENT - 5th February 2023**

**Hymns NEH 377, 433, 282, 235**

**FIRST READING Isaiah 58.1-9a** Shout out, do not hold back! Lift up
your voice like a trumpet! Announce to my people their rebellion, to the
house of Jacob their sins. Yet day after day they seek me and delight to
know my ways, as if they were a nation that practised righteousness and
did not forsake the ordinance of their God; they ask of me righteous
judgements, they delight to draw near to God. 'Why do we fast, but you
do not see? Why humble ourselves, but you do not notice?' Look, you
serve your own interest on your fast-day, and oppress all your workers.
Look, you fast only to quarrel and to fight and to strike with a wicked
fist. Such fasting as you do today will not make your voice heard on
high. Is such the fast that I choose, a day to humble oneself? Is it to
bow down the head like a bulrush, and to lie in sackcloth and ashes?
Will you call this a fast, a day acceptable to the Lord? Is not this the
fast that I choose: to loose the bonds of injustice, to undo the thongs
of the yoke, to let the oppressed go free, and to break every yoke? Is
it not to share your bread with the hungry, and bring the homeless poor
into your house; when you see the naked, to cover them, and not to hide
yourself from your own kin? Then your light shall break forth like the
dawn, and your healing shall spring up quickly; your vindicator shall go
before you, the glory of the Lord shall be your rearguard. Then you
shall call, and the Lord will answer; you shall cry for help, and he
will say, Here I am.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 112**

**Response: The good man is a light in the darkness for the upright.**

1\. He is a light in the darkness for the upright: he is generous,
merciful and just.

The good man takes pity and lends; he conducts his affairs with honour.
**R.**

2\. The just man will never waver: he will be remembered for ever.

He has no fear of evil news; with a firm heart he trusts in the Lord.
**R.**

3\. With a steadfast heart he will not fear; open-handed, he gives to
the poor.

His justice stands firm for ever: his head will be raised in glory.
**R.**

**SECOND READING 1 Corinthians 2.1-12** When I came to you, brothers and
sisters, I did not come proclaiming the mystery of God to you in lofty
words or wisdom. For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus
Christ, and him crucified. And I came to you in weakness and in fear and
in much trembling. My speech and my proclamation were not with plausible
words of wisdom,but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so
that your faith might rest not on human wisdom but on the power of God.
Yet among the mature we do speak wisdom, though it is not a wisdom of
this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to perish. But we
speak God's wisdom, secret and hidden, which God decreed before the ages
for our glory. None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if
they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. But, as it is
written, 'What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the human heart
conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him'--- these things
God has revealed to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches
everything, even the depths of God. For what human being knows what is
truly human except the human spirit that is within? So also no one
comprehends what is truly God's except the Spirit of God. Now we have
received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit that is from God,
so that we may understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.

**GOSPEL Matthew 5.13-20** 'You are the salt of the earth; but if salt
has lost its taste, how can its saltiness be restored? It is no longer
good for anything, but is thrown out and trampled under foot. 'You are
the light of the world. A city built on a hill cannot be hidden. No one
after lighting a lamp puts it under the bushel basket, but on the
lampstand, and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let
your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and
give glory to your Father in heaven. 'Do not think that I have come to
abolish the law or the prophets; I have come not to abolish but to
fulfil. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one
letter, not one stroke of a letter, will pass from the law until all is
accomplished. Therefore, whoever breaks one of the least of these
commandments, and teaches others to do the same, will be called least in
the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does them and teaches them will be
called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I tell you, unless your
righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never
enter the kingdom of heaven.

***ST MICHAEL\'S NEWS***

***A warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. Today we leave behind us the Epiphany season, and look
forward to the approach of Lent and Passiontide -- a time to ask
ourselves how serious we are about our Christian faith, and to seek our
Lord\'s help to "know Thee more clearly, love Thee more dearly, and
follow Thee more nearly." A special welcome to Fr Paul, who is kindly
celebrating today and will also be celebrating Mass for us on Thursday
at 10.30. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us for tea or coffee
in the Vestry Hall after Mass, so that we can welcome you properly.

**People, look east!** Our splendid east window, so wretchedly damaged
by vandals last summer, has finally been repaired -- as has the window
in the north porch, which we can now see for the little gem it is.
**Easthope Stained Glass** of Folkestone did the repairs, adding a new
external guard for the east window, and we are deeply thankful for their
technology, craftsmanship - and patience. We also much appreciate the
prompt, capable and helpful service of John White at **White\'s Upright
Scaffolding.**

**The Garden Working Party** really makes a difference! Thank you to all
who worked so hard in January. An **extra GWP** has been scheduled for
Saturday,**11th February,** at 9.30 am -- tasks to include finishing
work on the hedge. Hopefully the weather will cooperate! Speak to Martyn
for further information. There will be a **regular GWP** on Saturday,
**25th February,** at 9.30 am, for general clearing and tidying,
particularly in view of\...

**\...Bishop Norman\'s Visit on 26th February --** a chance for us all
to seek inspiration and encouragement on the first Sunday of Lent.
**Please sign up on the list at the back of church** if you can offer
food and/or help with the buffet lunch planned for apr√®s-Mass that day
-- and, most important, come to church on the 26th! The Bishop\'s
encouragement will be especially welcome in view of our\...

**\...Vacancy News:** A letter from the Bishop of Dover, received last
Monday, informs us that "I will not be taking the application further at
this time" and that the Archdeacon of Maidstone "will be speaking to you
about the next steps for making a new appointment."

**Our Quiet Day at The Friars** on Saturday March 25th promises to be
a refreshing and rewarding one. If you have not yet registered an
interest, do speak to Eleanor, Paul or Jonathan if you would like to
come. If you might be able to offer someone a lift, better still!

**The Consecration of the Bishop of Oswestry** took place on Candlemas
morning in the magnificent surroundings of the Quire of Canterbury
Cathedral. Two more bishops were consecrated in the afternoon -- but the
St Michael\'s party, numbering 6 in all, adjourned for lunch to the Kent
and Canterbury Club, at the invitation of Fr Derek. Warmest thanks to Fr
Derek for making it such a happy and convivial expedition.
