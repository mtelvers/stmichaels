**Sunday 11th September 2022**

**In this Mass we pray for the repose of the soul of Her Majesty Queen
Elizabeth II and thank God for her life of dedication and service.**

**Hymns today: Introit 456, Offertory 205,Communion 285, Recessional
239**

**First Reading: Lamentations 3: 17-26, 31-33.**

**The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases,\
his mercies never come to an end;\
****they are new every morning;\
great is your faithfulness.\
****"The Lord is my portion," says my soul,\
"therefore I will hope in him."**

The Lord is good to those who wait for him,\
to the soul that seeks him.\
It is good that one should wait quietly\
for the salvation of the Lord.

For the Lord will not reject forever.\
Although he causes grief, he will have compassion\
according to the abundance of his steadfast love;\
for he does not willingly afflict or grieve anyone.

**Psalm 121**

1 I lift up my eyes to the hills; from where is my help to come? My help
comes from the LORD, the maker of heaven and earth.

2 He will not let your foot be moved and he who watches over you will
not fall asleep. Behold, he who keeps watch over Israel shall neither
slumber nor sleep.

3 The LORD himself watches over you; the LORD is your shade at your
right hand, So that the sun shall not strike you by day, nor the moon by
night.

4 The LORD shall preserve you from all evil; it is he who shall keep you
safe. The LORD shall watch over your going out and your coming in, from
this time forth for evermore.

**2 Corinthians 4:16-5:4**

So we do not lose heart. Even though our outer nature is wasting away,
our inner nature is being renewed day by day. For this slight momentary
affliction is preparing us for an eternal weight of glory beyond all
measure, because we look not at what can be seen but at what cannot be
seen; for what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is
eternal. For we know that if the earthly tent we live in is destroyed,
we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens. For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our
heavenly dwelling--- if indeed, when we have taken it off we will not be
found naked. For while we are still in this tent, we groan under our
burden, because we wish not to be unclothed but to be further clothed,
so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.

**GOSPEL John 6:35-40**

Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will
never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty. But I
said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe. Everything
that the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes to me I
will never drive away; for I have come down from heaven, not to do my
own will, but the will of him who sent me. And this is the will of him
who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but
raise it up on the last day. This is indeed the will of my Father, that
all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life; and I will
raise them up on the last day.'
