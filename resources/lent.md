### Lent Prayer Card

This Prayer Card picks up the theme of our second season of ‘Keep Praying’. Keep Praying is a thread of prayer to weave through all we do in our churches and local communities and to help keep us connected in prayer across the diocese. We have a different theme for each liturgical season, and our theme for Lent is ‘Jesus, with us through the wilderness’.

##### FOOTSTEPS OF FAITH – Children’s Pilgrimage @Home

Friday 5th – Sunday 7th March 2021

Due to the ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, this year’s Children’s Pilgrimage is taking place online! This is a free event and there is no need to register.

This year’s theme is ‘Footsteps of Faith’ and we will be having a fun packed weekend of lively worship, music, stories and activities. Feet are very important in Walsingham and when we visit we are treading in the footsteps of countless pilgrims. Meet our very, very old Pilgrim Leader who has been coming to Walsingham since the Lady Richeldis had a vision of Mary way back in 1061!

Feet are also mentioned in the Bible many times! We will explore some of the stories in the Bible where feet are important.

Videos will be released here on this page and will also be available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs_HZRUr4E5dRGmlc1dB82sY2NrmER9tK) by clicking on the link.
