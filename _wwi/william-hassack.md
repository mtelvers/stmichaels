William known as Percy
Hassack known as Hassock

Percy’s father was a farm labourer in Norfolk. By 1901 aged 16, William /Percy was a carter. By 1914 
Percy was here in Maidstone. He attended the Parish Church of St Michael & All Angels where he sang 
in the Choir and he was a bell-ringer. The March 1915 Parish Magazine tells us that he was one of the 
bell ringers who had joined the Forces. In the Army he fought at Loos in September 1915. In May 1916 he 
was a Lance-Corporal and his machine gun emplacement was blown in and the gun and magazine buried.
Hassack extricated himself, dug out the gun and magazine, took up an alternative emplacement and 
came into action again under heavy fire. He was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for 
conspicuous gallantry. He was killed in action at the Somme in September 1916 in the Battle of the 
Somme when he had been promoted to the rank of Corporal.
