**THIRD SUNDAY IN ADVENT Hymns 12, 10, 275, 15**

**FIRST READING Isaiah 61.1-4,8-11** The spirit of the Lord God is upon
me, because the Lord has anointed me; he has sent me to bring good news
to the oppressed, to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to
the captives, and release to the prisoners; to proclaim the year of the
Lord's favour, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who
mourn; to provide for those who mourn in Zion--- to give them a garland
instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of
praise instead of a faint spirit. They will be called oaks of
righteousness, the planting of the Lord, to display his glory. They
shall build up the ancient ruins, they shall raise up the former
devastations; they shall repair the ruined cities, the devastations of
many generations.

For I the Lord love justice, I hate robbery and wrongdoing; I will
faithfully give them their recompense, and I will make an everlasting
covenant with them. Their descendants shall be known among the nations,
and their offspring among the peoples; all who see them shall
acknowledge that they are a people whom the Lord has blessed. I will
greatly rejoice in the Lord, my whole being shall exult in my God; for
he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has covered me with
the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,
and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels. For as the earth brings
forth its shoots, and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring
up, so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise to spring up
before all the nations.

**RESPONSORIAL CANTICLE** ***Response:  My spirit rejoices in God my
Saviour.***

My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord;

My spirit rejoices in God my Saviour.

For he has looked with favour on his lowly servant;

from this day all generations will call me bless√®d.

The Almighty has done great things for me,

and holy is his name.* **R***

He has mercy on those who fear him

in every generation.

He has shown the strength of his arm;

he has scattered the proud in their conceit.* **R***

He has cast down the mighty from their thrones

and has lifted up the lowly.

He has filled the hungry with good things

and the rich he has sent away empty. ***R***

He has come to the help of his servant, Israel,

for he has remembered his promise of mercy.

The promise he made to our forebears:

to Abraham and his children for ever. ***R***

**SECOND READING 1 Thessalonians 5.16-24** Rejoice always, pray without
ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God
in Christ Jesus for you. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise the
words of prophets, but test everything; hold fast to what is good;
abstain from every form of evil. May the God of peace himself sanctify
you entirely; and may your spirit and soul and body be kept sound and
blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you
is faithful, and he will do this.

**GOSPEL John 1.6-8,19-28** There was a man sent from God, whose name
was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all
might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to
testify to the light. This is the testimony given by John when the Jews
sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, 'Who are you?' He
confessed and did not deny it, but confessed, 'I am not the Messiah.'
And they asked him, 'What then? Are you Elijah?' He said, 'I am not.'
'Are you the prophet?' He answered, 'No.' Then they said to him, 'Who
are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say
about yourself?' He said, 'I am the voice of one crying out in the
wilderness, "Make straight the way of the Lord"', as the prophet Isaiah
said. Now they had been sent from the Pharisees. They asked him, 'Why
then are you baptizing if you are neither the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor
the prophet?' John answered them, 'I baptize with water. Among you
stands one whom you do not know, the one who is coming after me; I am
not worthy to untie the thong of his sandal.' This took place in Bethany
across the Jordan where John was baptizing.
