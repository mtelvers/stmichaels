**MIDNIGHT MASS OF CHRISTMAS Hymns 34, 30, 32, 26**

**First reading: Isaiah 9:1-7**

The people that walked in darkness has seen a great light; on those who
live in a land of deep shadow a light has shone. You have made their
gladness greater, you have made their joy increase; they rejoice in your
presence as men rejoice at harvest time, as men are happy when they are
dividing the spoils.

For the yoke that was weighing on him, the bar across his shoulders,

the rod of his oppressor, these you break as on the day of Midian.

For all the footgear of battle, every cloak rolled in blood, is burnt,

and consumed by fire.

For there is a child born for us, a son given to us and dominion is laid
on his shoulders; and this is the name they give him: Wonder-Counsellor,
Mighty-God, Eternal-Father, Prince-of-Peace. Wide is his dominion in a
peace that has no end, for the throne of David and for his royal power,
which he establishes and makes secure in justice and integrity. From
this time onwards and for ever, the jealous love of the Lord of Hosts
will do this.

**Responsorial Psalm - Psalm 95(96):1-3,11-13**

**Response: Today a saviour has been born to us: he is Christ the
Lord.**

O sing a new song to the Lord, sing to the Lord all the earth.

O sing to the Lord, bless his name. **R.**

Proclaim his help day by day,

tell among the nations his glory, and his wonders among all the peoples.
**R**

Let the heavens rejoice and earth be glad, let the sea and all within it
thunder praise,

let the land and all it bears rejoice, all the trees of the wood shout
for joy

at the presence of the Lord, for he comes, he comes to rule the earth.

With justice he will rule the world, he will judge the peoples with his
truth. **R**

**Second reading:** **Titus 2:11-14**

God's grace has been revealed, and it has made salvation possible for
the whole human race and taught us that what we have to do is to give up
everything that does not lead to God, and all our worldly ambitions; we
must be self-restrained and live good and religious lives here in this
present world, while we are waiting in hope for the blessing which will
come with the Appearing of the glory of our great God and saviour Christ
Jesus. He sacrificed himself for us in order to set us free from all
wickedness and to purify a people so that it could be his very own and
would have no ambition except to do good.

**Gospel Luke 2: 1-14**

Caesar Augustus issued a decree for a census of the whole world to be
taken. This census -- the first -- took place while Quirinius was
governor of Syria, and everyone went to his own town to be registered.
So Joseph set out from the town of Nazareth in Galilee and travelled up
to Judaea, to the town of David called Bethlehem, since he was of
David's House and line, in order to be registered together with Mary,
his betrothed, who was with child. While they were there the time came
for her to have her child, and she gave birth to a son, her first born.
She wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger because
there was no room for them at the inn.

In the countryside close by there were shepherds who lived in the fields
and took it in turns to watch their flocks during the night. The angel
of the Lord appeared to them and the glory of the Lord shone round them.
They were terrified, but the angel said, 'Do not be afraid. Listen, I
bring you news of great joy, a joy to be shared by the whole people.
Today in the town of David a saviour has been born to you; he is Christ
the Lord. And here is a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped in
swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.' And suddenly with the angel
there was a great throng of the heavenly host, praising God and singing:

'Glory to God in the highest heaven,

and peace to men who enjoy his favour.'

**NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S**

A warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St
Michael\'s, as we celebrate this Midnight Mass of Christmas. A special
welcome to our celebrant Fr Paul, to whom we are deeply indebted for his
unfailing support during this time of interregnum. If you are new to St
Michael\'s and can\'t at first find your way around the service booklet
or hymn book, please don\'t hesitate to seek help from a neighbour!

**Our Carol Service** last Sunday saw us welcoming (despite the weather)
a number of old friends: former organist Gareth, several former choir
members and some familiar faces in the congregation. Thank you to
everyone who took part, in whatever capacity: to Fr Paul for leading the
service, to Gareth and Catherine for gathering the singers together and
rehearsing them, to the readers, to Sue for generously providing the
festive refreshments and to Margaret for helping her serve them. Thank
you all for giving us that lovely preparation for Christmas, combining
quiet reflection and happy conviviality.

**Still on a musical note,** warmest thanks to Malcolm, who is playing
the organ at this Mass and has been indefatigable in his support on
Sundays ever since the spring. Tomorrow morning Malcolm will have a
well-earned rest, and for our morning Mass we shall have recorded music
kindly provided by Martyn; so grateful thanks also to Martyn!

***Togethe*r is an informative and readable FREE newspaper** produced
three times a year by The Society of St Wilfrid and St Hilda, to which
our parish is affiliated. The latest issue has arrived and is at the
back of the church -- why not take a copy home, and get a sense of what
is going on in Society parishes elsewhere, and what The Society is
contributing to the life of the Church of England? It can be all too
easy to develop a kind of tunnel vision and lose sight of the bigger
picture. Could we pray more for the clergy and people of other parishes,
in this country and abroad, and for those who make decisions affecting
the wider Church?

**From our Tower:** It was wonderful to hear St Michael\'s bells in
action just before the Carol Service! A team of heroic ringers got here,
despite the perilous weather conditions, and the sound filled us with
joyous anticipation. Thank you, everyone.

**Late extra -- Another Thank You,** this time to Treasurer Nelly, who
in the autumn spent considerable time and effort in dealing with a
complicated form about the church heating. The result has been a grant
from the Diocese to help with our energy costs! This has just arrived in
the bank, and we all have cause to be grateful for Nelly\'s initiative
and diligence.

**A very happy and blessed Christmas to all our readers!**

**May the joy of the angels, the eagerness of the shepherds, the
perseverance of the wise men, the obedience of Mary and Joseph, and the
peace of the Christ Child be ours this Christmas and always.**
