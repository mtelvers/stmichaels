FOR OUR PRAYERS:

We pray for the Roman Catholic Church and for the Cardinals as they elect the next Pope.

We pray for our Confirmation candidates Andy, Zoe and Mark, and for Bishop Luke as he prepares to Celebrate Mass
for us and Confirm Andy, Zoe and Mark on Sunday 1st June.

We pray for the Church of England, for its renewal and revitalisation and for its mission and ministry, for our Diocese
and Deanery, and for the appointment of a new Archbishop of Canterbury - that in the midst of the various processes
and procedures the answer will be in accordance with God’s will for His Church.


We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington and Trevor Joseph.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Ron Barton.
