**THE TRANSFIGURATION OF THE LORD**

**FIRST READING Daniel 7.9,10,13,14**

As I watched, thrones were set in place, and an Ancient One took his
throne; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head like
pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and its wheels were burning
fire.

A stream of fire issued and flowed out from his presence. A thousand
thousand served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending
him.

The court sat in judgement, and the books were opened.

As I watched in the night visions, I saw one like a human being coming
with the clouds of heaven. And he came to the Ancient One and was
presented before him. To him was given dominion and glory and kingship,
that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him. His dominion
is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and his kingship is
one that shall never be destroyed.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 97**

***Response: The Lord is King, most high, above all the earth.***

1\. The Lord is King; let earth rejoice;

the many coastlands be glad.

His throne, justice and right. ***R.***

2\. The skies proclaim his justice:

all peoples see his glory.

All you spirits, worship him. ***R.***

3\. For you indeed are the Lord:

most high above all the earth,

exalted far above all spirits. ***R.***

**SECOND READING 2 Peter 1.16-19**

For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you
the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we had been
eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honour and glory from God
the Father when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory,
saying, 'This is my Son, my Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.' We
ourselves heard this voice come from heaven, while we were with him on
the holy mountain. So we have the prophetic message more fully
confirmed. You will do well to be attentive to this as to a lamp shining
in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your
hearts.

**GOSPEL Luke 9.28-36**

Now about eight days after these sayings Jesus took with him Peter and
John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was
praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became
dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to
him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he
was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were
weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his
glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him,
Peter said to Jesus, 'Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make
three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah'---not
knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and
overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud.
Then from the cloud came a voice that said, 'This is my Son, my Chosen;
listen to him!' When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And
they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they
had seen.

***NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S***

***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul, our
celebrant this morning, who will also kindly be saying Mass for us on
**Thursday at 10.30 am.** If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us in
the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can welcome you properly.

***Please note that there will be no Mass on Thursday, 17th August, as
Fr Paul will be at Walsingham on pilgrimage during that week.***

**Thank you** to everyone who has been working so hard on the
redecoration of the Vestry Hall, and particular thanks to Trevor
Gatehouse for his advice and help in procuring the materials. The
progress already made does everyone credit, but help will still be
welcome. Please speak to Martyn or Paul if you are able and willing to
join the decorators.

**On Sunday, August 13th, we shall be looking forward to the
Assumption of Our Lady. We look forward also to welcoming Archdeacon
Andrew, who will be preaching at Mass. Please try to be here to join in
our greetings.**

**CALLING ALL AVAILABLE SINGERS! There will be a choir practice on
Friday 11th at 6.15 pm.**

**Looking ahead: Saturday, September 9th, 10 am -- 4 pm, is a Heritage
Open Day.** As our church is a listed building, we want our community --
and visitors from further afield -- to be able to enjoy our lovely Angel
Windows, and, God willing, to get a sense of the beauty of holiness as
St Michael\'s tries to show it. We shall need volunteers to bake
cakes/biscuits, make tea and coffee, welcome visitors and act as
stewards, answer questions, and sign in the Ride and Stride participants
-- including Catherine - who will be doing their sponsored walk or
cycle-ride on the same day in aid of the Friends of Kent Churches. A
parcel of publicity and decorating materials has already arrived from
the organisers. This is an important opportunity to develop our
community links and to encourage people to explore our building - and
what it stands for. **Please put the date in your diary and see how you
could help.**

**From our Tower: Our Tower will be welcoming visiting ringers on
Saturday, 12th August, from 3 pm to 4.30 pm,** and we all look forward
to hearing our lovely bells being in action, and being appreciated,
beyond the usual routine.

Remembering Irene Horton (12/7/22) and Jeanette Ardley (17/7/2016),
R.I.P..

Bishop Norman will be leading a weekend **pilgrimage to Walsingham** for
members of Richborough family parishes, from Friday 8th to Sunday 10th
September. To book, please contact the Shrine accommodation office
direct on **01328 820239**, indicating when you book that this is for
the **Richborough Family Pilgrimage.** If you have never been to
Walsingham and are inclined to be hesitant, that weekend might be for
you; it will of course be less expensive than a longer pilgrimage, and
would be a chance to "test the water". Bishop Norman\'s connection with
Walsingham goes back many years (he was once vicar of that parish), and
a Walsingham pilgrimage under his leadership should prove to be a
spiritual shot in the arm!

**An opportunity for this autumn?** Canterbury Diocese is running an
eight-session **"Deepening Discipleship"** course which will take place
on Wednesday evenings via Zoom, beginning on 27th September -- thus
participants will not be faced with cold and tiring journeys in the
evenings. This course encourages participants to reflect on, and
develop, their Christian life, and it also provides a starting-point for
anyone who is exploring the possibility of undertaking lay ministry.
Applications close on September 13th. Visit [Deepening Discipleship -
Diocese of Canterbury
(canterburydiocese.org)](https://www.canterburydiocese.org/our-life/spirituality-discipleship/explore-discipleship/deepening-discipleship/deepening-discipleship#_blank)
for further information and an application form. (A chance for personal
growth -- or, indeed, might God be calling **you** to serve St
Michael\'s as a lay minister?)

Meanwhile, **we do need more servers!** Servers (who can be make or
female) have a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the Faith and
the liturgy, as well as having the privilege of making an important
contribution to our worship. Why not speak to Fr Paul about becoming a
server?
