*A very warm welcome* to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers
to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us for
refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can
welcome you properly.

"Last of all, we humbly sing glory to our God and King,

Glory to the One in Three, on the Feast of Trinity."

**Our Services in the coming week:** Thursday -- Mass at 10.30 am;
Sunday -- Mass at 10.30 am.

Next Sunday we shall be celebrating **Corpus Christi** -- a special day
of thanksgiving for the Holy Eucharist. "Thanks be to God for His gift
beyond words."

**Peggy Thresh\'s Memorial Service** will take place in church on
Thursday, June 27th, at 11.30 am, and will be preceded by a
quarter-peal from our Tower. Please pass on the information to others
who knew her.

**Summer Fun Day: June 15th!** We can start looking forward to this
already -- and publicising it. We\'ll have competitions and attractions
for everyone from 10 am to 2 pm, including a tombola, a plant stall,
crafts and gifts, cakes and refreshments. It will be the official
birthday of HM The King -- so children dressed as kings and princesses
will be most welcome and may win a prize! Could you contribute plants,
craft items, tombola items (preferably with a garden/picnic/outdoor
theme) - or cakes etc. on the day? Please note Alison Heywood\'s poster
in church about offerings for the plant stall. Entries will also be
invited for the Best Crown and the Best Scarecrow! If you would like to
offer further ideas, or help, Sara (07837 919761) will be delighted to
hear from you.

**Thank you** to Martyn, William and others from St Michael\'s who
welcomed the sixth-form volunteers from Oakwood Park Grammar School to
our church on the 21st May. Thank you, too, to Mary and Mike, who
ensured that no one was hungry or thirsty! And many thanks to the
Oakwood Park students, and their Director Miss Kirsty Ryan, for
arranging this generous and worthwhile volunteering scheme.

**Friends of Kent Churches** -- the charity supported by the Ride and
Stride event held every September -- is 75 years old this year. **Ride
and Stride 2024 will take place on September 14th**, and a **special
evensong** at All Saints\', Maidstone, is planned for 3.30 pm on
September 21st. It isn\'t too early to Indicate that you would like to
attend that service; email <frofkch@outlook.com>. And please note that
**Heritage Open Day** will coincide, as usual, with Ride and Stride on
September 14th, and we shall open the church, as usual, to welcome
visitors who come to enjoy our Angel Windows. This year\'s theme for the
day is **"Routes, Networks, Connections"** - ideas welcome!
