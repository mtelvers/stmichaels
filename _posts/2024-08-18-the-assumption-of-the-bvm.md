# This Sunday we keep the Feast of The Assumption of Mary into Heaven

# FIRST READING ( Revelation 11: 19; 12:1-6, 10)

## A reading from the book of Revelation.

The sanctuary of God in heaven opened, and the ark of the covenant could
be seen inside it. Now a great sign appeared in heaven; a woman, adorned
with the sun, standing on the moon, and with the twelve stars on her
head for a crown. She was pregnant, and in labour, crying aloud in the
pangs of childbirth. Then a second sign appeared in the sky, a huge red
dragon which had seven heads and ten horns, and each of the seven heads
crowned with a coronet. Its tail dragged a third of the stars from the
sky and dropped them to the earth, and the dragon stopped in front of
the woman as she was having the child, so that he could eat it as soon
as it was born from its mother. The woman brought the male child into
the world, the son who was to rule all the nations with an iron sceptre,
and the child was taken straight up to God and to his throne, while the
woman escaped into the desert, where God had made a place of safety
ready. Then I heard a voice shout from heaven 'Victory and power and
empire for ever have been won by our God, and all authority for his
Christ.'

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 45)

## Response: On your right stands the queen, in garments of gold.

1\. The daughters of kings are among your loved ones.\
On your right stands the queen in gold of Ophir.\
Listen, O daughter, give ear to my words:\
forget your own people and your father's house. ***R.***

2\. So will the king desire your beauty:\
He is your Lord, pay homage to him.\
They are escorted amid gladness and joy;\
they pass within the palaces of the King. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (1 Corinthians 15: 20-26)

## A reading from the First letter of St Paul to the Corinthians.

Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have
died. For since death came through a human being, the resurrection of
the dead has also come through a human being; for as all die in Adam, so
all will be made alive in Christ. But each in his own order: Christ the
first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ. Then comes
the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, after he has
destroyed every ruler and every authority and power. For he must reign
until he has put all his enemies under his feet. The last enemy to be
destroyed is death.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 1: 39-56)

In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the
hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted
Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the child leapt in her
womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a
loud cry, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your
womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes
to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in
my womb leapt for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would
be a fulfilment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.'

And Mary said,\
'My soul magnifies the Lord,\
   and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour,\
for he has looked with favour on the lowliness of his servant.\
   Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;\
for the Mighty One has done great things for me,\
   and holy is his name.\
His mercy is for those who fear him\
   from generation to generation.\
He has shown strength with his arm;\
   he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.\
He has brought down the powerful from their thrones,\
   and lifted up the lowly;\
he has filled the hungry with good things,\
   and sent the rich away empty.\
He has helped his servant Israel,\
   in remembrance of his mercy,\
according to the promise he made to our ancestors,\
   to Abraham and to his descendants for ever.'

And Mary remained with her for about three months and then returned to
her home.

# NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S

## Priest-in-Charge Fr John Ainslie ([revjohnainslie\@gmail.com](mailto:revjohnainslie@gmail.com); 01628 629827)

**A very warm welcome** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so we can welcome
you properly.

**PRAYER REQUEST SLIPS** are available at the back of church if you want
to request prayer for yourself, for someone else or for a particular
situation.

**SERVICES THIS WEEK: NO MASS ON THURSDAY THIS WEEK**, next Sunday Sung
Mass 10.30am followed by refreshments.

**Enhancing our Church Presence.** Those who have been to our Church
recently will have been greeted by the sight and fragrance of beautiful
lilies outside the main door -- enhancing the appearance of our church
building, giving happiness to those who see them and speaking of the
love, joy and beauty of our Christian faith. A sign of the life of our
Christian community here at St Michael's. We are fortunate to have a
large and prominent corner site on the main road and we will aim to
maintain the colourful containers, but more help and ideas to enhance
the beauty of our church as seen by passers-by would be welcome, for
example volunteers to 'adopt', care for and maybe replant sections of
the borders would be particularly welcome -- as Jacqui already does in
memory of her husband.

**Ride+Stride** takes place this year on Saturday 14th September --
for those not familiar with it, this is a day when volunteers are
encouraged to visit churches in their own area especially by walking,
running or cycling, and being sponsored for so doing. The sponsorship
money is split 50:50 between the church chosen by the volunteer, and the
Friends of Kent Churches, which makes donations towards care and
maintenance of churches across the County. Catherine Garland is
volunteering so do consider adding your name to her orange sponsorship
form at the back of church sponsorship can be gift-aided, and 50% of
money she raises will come back to us. We may be submitting applications
to the Friends of Kent churches for various maintenance works around our
building, so it is good to be seen as a church that supports the
Friends. If you would like to be a volunteer and be sponsored, Catherine
Garland or myself can get the forms for you.

**Heritage Open Day is also on 14th September**, and we will be
opening our church for the day with refreshments and information about
the history and architecture of our church and the Oxford Movement which
inspired it (and still inspires our worship, teaching and pastoral
care). **Please put the date in your diary and do come along** to learn
more about our church history and to welcome those who will be visiting
the church. If you would like to help with refreshments, bunting,
advertising or in any other way do please let me or Eleanor know.

**Dates for your Diary: Tuesday 1st October -- Deanery Roadshow at St
Lukes Church**. An opportunity to learn more about the churches within
our Deanery and diocese and think about encouraging church growth and
ministry. Open to all, but especially members of the PCC. **Saturday
12th October, Deanery Environment Conference, Canterbury.**

**Cathedral News:** Through August, Canterbury Cathedral has Discovery
Days, painting days based on the stained glass windows, open-air
performances of A Midsummer Night's Dream and Peter Pan. See their
website for details.

**FOR OUR PRAYERS:** We pray for the appointment of a new Bishop of
Richborough, and for the Diocesan Forward in Faith Pilgrimage to
Walsingham this week. We pray for peace particularly in Gaza and the
Middle East.

**We pray for those in need**, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis
Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Frank Carr, Lindsay Wheeler,
Peter Rowe, William Danes-Volkov, Martyn Nash, Lisa Thompset, Fran,
Keanna, Ellie Tomlinson and Claire Goodwin.

**We pray for the recently departed**, including Luke. We remember those
who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous generations,
and we pray for those whose year's mind occurs this week: Rose Logan
Green.
