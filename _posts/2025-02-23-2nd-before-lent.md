# COLLECT

Almighty God, you have created the heavens and the earth
and made us in your own image:

teach us to discern your hand in all your works and your likeness in all
your children;

through Jesus Christ your Son our Lord, who with you and the Holy Spirit
reigns supreme over all things,

now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Genesis 2: 4b-9, 15-end)

## A reading from the prophet Jeremiah.

In the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens, when no
plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet
sprung up---for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth,
and there was no one to till the ground; but a stream would rise from
the earth, and water the whole face of the ground--- then the Lord God
formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life; and the man became a living being. And the Lord God
planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he
had formed. Out of the ground the Lord God made to grow every tree that
is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the
midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it
and keep it. And the Lord God commanded the man, 'You may freely eat of
every tree of the garden; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall
die.'

Then the Lord God said, 'It is not good that the man should be alone; I
will make him a helper as his partner.' So out of the ground
the Lord God formed every animal of the field and every bird of the air,
and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever
the man called each living creature, that was its name. The man gave
names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of
the field; but for the man there was not found a helper as his
partner. So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and
he slept; then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place with
flesh. And the rib that the Lord God had taken from the man he made into
a woman and brought her to the man. Then the man said,\
'This at last is bone of my bones\
   and flesh of my flesh;\
this one shall be called Woman,\
   for out of Man this one was taken.'\
Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and clings to his wife,
and they become one flesh. And the man and his wife were both naked, and
were not ashamed.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 65)

## Response: In your righteousness you show us marvellous things.

1\. Lord, you still the raging of the sea
the noise of the waves, and the madness of the peoples.
You visit the earth and bless it
and cause it to be full of fruitfulness. ***R.***

2\. You are the hope of all the earth
and crown the year with goodness.
In your righteousness you show us marvellous things\
O God of our salvation. ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Revelation 4)

## A reading from the revelation to St John the Divine.

After this I looked, and there in heaven a door stood open! And the
first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said,
'Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this.' At
once I was in the spirit, and there in heaven stood a throne, with one
seated on the throne! And the one seated there looks like jasper and
cornelian, and around the throne is a rainbow that looks like an
emerald. Around the throne are twenty-four thrones, and seated on the
thrones are twenty-four elders, dressed in white robes, with golden
crowns on their heads. Coming from the throne are flashes of lightning,
and rumblings and peals of thunder, and in front of the throne burn
seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God; and in front
of the throne there is something like a sea of glass, like crystal.

Around the throne, and on each side of the throne, are four living
creatures, full of eyes in front and behind: the first living creature
like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living
creature with a face like a human face, and the fourth living creature
like a flying eagle. And the four living creatures, each of them with
six wings, are full of eyes all around and inside. Day and night without
ceasing they sing,

'Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God the Almighty, who was and is and is to
come.'

And whenever the living creatures give glory and honour and thanks to
the one who is seated on the throne, who lives for ever and ever, the
twenty-four elders fall before the one who is seated on the throne and
worship the one who lives for ever and ever; they cast their crowns
before the throne, singing, 'You are worthy, our Lord and God, to
receive glory and honour and power, for you created all things, and by
your will they existed and were created.'

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 8: 22-25)

One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples, and he said to them,
'Let us go across to the other side of the lake.' So they put out, and
while they were sailing he fell asleep. A gale swept down on the lake,
and the boat was filling with water, and they were in danger. They went
to him and woke him up, shouting, 'Master, Master, we are perishing!'
And he woke up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they ceased,
and there was a calm. He said to them, 'Where is your faith?' They were
afraid and amazed, and said to one another, 'Who then is this, that he
commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?'
