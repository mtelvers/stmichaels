The Church of England
---------------------

![](/media/church-of-england.png)

The Church is led by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York and 106 other bishops. They provide guidance and direction to the churches across the country and make decisions on the Church in society. The General Synod is an assembly of bishops, clergy and laity, and creates the laws of the Church. The seven National Church Institutions work together to support the mission and ministries of the Church.

The Society is an ecclesial body, led by a Council of Bishops. The purposes of the Society are: to promote and maintain catholic teaching and practice within the Church of England; to provide episcopal oversight to which churches, institutions and individuals will freely submit themselves; to guarantee a ministry in the historic apostolic succession in which they can have confidence. The parishes of The Society enjoy a relationship of full communion not only with the relevant bishop of The Society but also with all the other parishes of The Society.
