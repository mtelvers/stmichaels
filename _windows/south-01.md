“Fear not, Zacharias, for thy prayer is heard.” The angel Gabriel stands “on the right side of the altar of incense” (our left as we look at the window) as the elderly priest Zachariah, holding a thurible, makes the appointed offering of incense in the temple. Note the six-winged seraph pictured on the hanging behind the altar. Gabriel brings from God the message that Zachariah and his wife Elizabeth, hitherto childless, will have a son – John the Baptist (Luke 1).
