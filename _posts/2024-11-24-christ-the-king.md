# THE COLLECT FOR THE FEAST OF CHRIST THE KING

Eternal Father, whose Son Jesus Christ ascended to the throne of heaven\
that he might rule over all things as Lord and King:\
keep the Church in the unity of the Spirit and in the bond of peace,\
and bring the whole created order to worship at his feet;\
who is alive and reigns with you,\
in the unity of the Holy Spirit,\
one God, now and for ever.\
**AMEN.**

# FIRST READING (Daniel 7: 9-10, 13-14)

## A reading from the book of Daniel.

As I watched, thrones were set in place, and an Ancient One took
his throne; his clothing was white as snow, and the hair of his head
like pure wool; his throne was fiery flames, and its wheels were burning
fire. A stream of fire flowed out from his presence. A thousand thousand
served him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood attending him.

The court sat in judgement and the books were opened. As I watched in
the night visions, I saw one like a human being coming with the clouds
of heaven. And he came to the Ancient One and was presented before him.

To him was given dominion and glory and kingship, that all peoples,
nations, and languages should serve him.

His dominion is an everlasting dominion that shall not pass away, and
his kingship is one that shall never be destroyed.

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Ps 93)

## Response: The Lord is King!

1\. The Lord is king, he is robed in majesty,\
He has established the world, it shall never be moved.\
Your throne is established from of old;\
you are from everlasting, for ever and ever. ***R.***

2\. The floods have lifted up their voice,\
The floods shout and roar.\
More majestic than the thunders of many waters,\
more majestic than the mighty waves of the sea,\
Majestic on high is the Lord! ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Revelation 1: 4-8)

## A reading from the Revelation to St John the Divine.

John,

To the seven churches that are in Asia:

Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come,
and from the seven spirits who are before his throne, and from Jesus
Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler
of the kings of the earth.

To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood, and made us
to be a kingdom, priests serving his God and Father, to him be glory and
dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

Look! He is coming with the clouds; every eye will see him, even those
who pierced him; and on his account all the tribes of the earth will
wail. So it is to be. Amen.

'I am the Alpha and the Omega', says the Lord God, 'who is and who was
and who is to come, the Almighty'.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 18: 33-37)

Pilate entered the headquarters again, summoned Jesus, and asked him,
'Are you the King of the Jews?' Jesus answered, 'Do you ask this on your
own, or did others tell you about me?' Pilate replied, 'I am not a Jew,
am I? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me.
What have you done?' Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not from this world.
If my kingdom were from this world, my followers would be fighting to
keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But as it is, my kingdom is
not from here.' Pilate asked him, 'So you are a king?' Jesus answered,
'You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I came into
the world, to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth
listens to my voice.'
