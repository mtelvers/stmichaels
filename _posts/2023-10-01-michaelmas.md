**MICHAELMAS (transferred) Hymns 190, 343, 336, 475**

**FIRST READING Genesis 28: 10-17Jacob left Beer-sheba and went toward
Haran. He came to a certain place and stayed there for the night,
because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put
it under his head and lay down in that place. And he dreamed that there
was a ladder set up on the earth, the top of it reaching to heaven; and
the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And the Lord
stood beside him and said, "I am the Lord, the God of Abraham your
father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to
you and to your offspring; and your offspring shall be like the dust of
the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and
to the north and to the south; and all the families of the earth shall
be blessed in you and in your offspring. Know that I am with you and
will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for
I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you." Then
Jacob woke from his sleep and said, "Surely the Lord is in this
place---and I did not know it!" And he was afraid, and said, "How
awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and
this is the gate of heaven."**

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 103 *Response: Bless the Lord, O my soul***

**The [Lord]{.smallcaps} has set his throne in heaven,\
and his kingship has dominion over all. R**

> Bless the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, you angels of his,\
> you mighty ones who do his bidding, \*\
> and hearken to the voice of his word. **R**
>
> Bless the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, all you his hosts, \*\
> you ministers of his who do his will. **R**
>
> Bless the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, all you works of his,\
> in all places of his dominion; \*\
> bless the [Lord]{.smallcaps}, O my soul. **R**

**SECOND READING Revelation 12: 7-12 And war broke out in heaven;
Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. The dragon and his
angels fought back, but they were defeated, and there was no longer any
place for them in heaven. The great dragon was thrown down, that ancient
serpent, who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole
world---he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down
with him.** Then I heard a loud voice in heaven, proclaiming,\
'Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God
and the authority of his Messiah,\
for the accuser of our comrades has been thrown down, who accuses them
day and night before our God.\
But they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of
their testimony,\
for they did not cling to life even in the face of death.\
Rejoice then, you heavens and those who dwell in them!\
But woe to the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you\
with great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!'

**GOSPEL John 1:47-51** When Jesus saw Nathanael coming towards him, he
said of him, 'Here is truly an Israelite in whom there is no
deceit!' Nathanael asked him, 'Where did you come to know me?' Jesus
answered, 'I saw you under the fig tree before Philip called
you.' Nathanael replied, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the
King of Israel!' Jesus answered, 'Do you believe because I told you that
I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than
these.' And he said to him, 'Very truly, I tell you, you will see heaven
opened and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of
Man.'

***NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S***

***On this our patronal festival, a very warm welcome*** to any new
readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special
welcome and thanks to Fr Paul Matthias, our celebrant this morning, who
will also kindly be saying Mass for us on **Thursday at 10.30 am.**
Everyone is warmly invited to **buffet lunch in the Vestry Hall after
Mass today.** If new to St Michael\'s, you are particularly welcome.
**Thank you** to all whose offerings of food and help have made this
possible!

**Valerie Brown**, a faithful member of St Michael\'s congregation for
many decades, died peacefully on Michaelmas morning. She will be
remembered by so many for her flower arranging, her singing, her work as
Electoral Roll officer and the unfailing kindness and charm with which
she carried out countless tasks for this church, many of them the
inconspicuous ones known chiefly to God. We extend our sympathy to her
family, and thank God for her example and for all she has meant to us.
May she rest in peace and rise in glory.

**Our lovely series of Angel Windows** (Old Testament angels on the
north side, New Testament angels on the south side) helps to make our
church a Grade 2 Listed Building. Perhaps we have grown so used to our
windows that we need to take a fresh look at them. Today would be a good
time to linger over them and thank God for the ministry of His holy
angels -- and to be inspired by the generosity and dedication of those
who saved to have those windows installed, one by one, 140 years ago.

Margaret Smith, Ralph, Mary and Mike received a warm welcome at St
Michael and All Angels\', Harbledown on Friday at the parish\'s Patronal
Festival. Solemn Mass was celebrated by the Rector, Fr Peter Harnden,
and the preacher was Fr Angus Beattie, Rector of St Andrew\'s, Deal and
Holy Trinity, Ramsgate. Celebrations continued in the church hall with a
magnificent buffet-reception.

**Our Harvest Thanksgiving is next Sunday,** October 8th. Everyone is
invited to enjoy a glass of wine and cake after Mass. Please, if you
can, come to church with an offering of food to be delivered to the
Christian Care Foodbank in Knightrider Street. Imperishable food is most
welcome, but so is fresh garden produce. **Thank you in advance for your
generosity** -- particularly appreciated in these difficult times.

**Choral Evensong** often speaks not only to active Anglicans but to
many people whose links with the Church are far less definite.
**Everyone** **will be welcome** **at Choral Evensong at St Michael\'s
on Sunday, 29th October, ar 5 pm,** with a gathered choir conducted by
Gareth James. Do pass the word around! **Grateful thanks also to Gareth
and the extra singers** for leading our music this morning.

**The Maidstone Deanery Roadshow at St Luke\'s, Maidstone, on October
16th at 7 pm - what is it?** Deanery Roadshows are a chance for
parishes to learn about the financial plans of the diocese and how they
will affect the deanery and its parishes. Those present can ask
questions and, indeed, make representations about financial matters that
concern them. Recently St Michael\'s has made its presence felt, and its
voice heard, on these occasions. Please note the date and try to come
along.

**Our pre-Christmas Fair, on 2^nd^ December from 12 noon to 4 pm,** will
need the work of cake-bakers, jam-makers, plant-growers, craftspeople,
prize-donors - and others, including kindly angels who will give help on
the day. It will also be a better Fair if people contribute bright ideas
beforehand. How could you help? Sara will be delighted to hear (in
person or on **07837 919761**) from anyone who is willing to be involved
in any way. Let\'s get together to make it a wonderful day for all
concerned!

**A chance to support the Royal National Lifeboat Institution:**
there\'s a box for your used stamps in the narthex. Please don\'t try to
remove them from the envelope -- if feasible, about an inch of envelope
all round is ideal. Thank you!
