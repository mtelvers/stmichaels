# FIRST READING ( 1 Kings 19: 4-8)

## A reading from the First book of Kings.

Elijah went a day's journey into the wilderness, and came and sat down
under a solitary broom tree. He asked that he might die: 'It is enough;
now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my
ancestors.' Then he lay down under the broom tree and fell asleep.
Suddenly an angel touched him and said to him, 'Get up and eat.' He
looked, and there at his head was a cake baked on hot stones, and a jar
of water. He ate and drank and lay down again. The angel of
the Lord came a second time, touched him, and said, 'Get up and eat,
otherwise the journey will be too much for you.' He got up and ate and
drank; then he went in the strength of that food for forty days and
forty nights to Horeb the mount of God.

# SECOND READING (Ephesians 4: 25 -- 5: 2)

## A reading from the letter of St Paul to the Ephesians.

So then, putting away falsehood, let all of us speak the truth to our
neighbours, for we are members of one another. Be angry but do not sin;
do not let the sun go down on your anger, and do not make room for the
devil. Thieves must give up stealing; rather let them labour and work
honestly with their own hands, so as to have something to share with the
needy. Let no evil talk come out of your mouths, but only what is useful
for building up, as there is need, so that your words may give grace to
those who hear. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, with which you
were marked with a seal for the day of redemption. Put away from you all
bitterness and wrath and anger and wrangling and slander, together with
all malice, and be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one
another, as God in Christ has forgiven you. Therefore be imitators of
God, as beloved children, and live in love, as Christ loved us and gave
himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 6: 35, 41-51)

Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will
never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.

Then the Jews began to complain about him because he said, 'I am the
bread that came down from heaven.' They were saying, 'Is not this Jesus,
the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say,
"I have come down from heaven"?' Jesus answered them, 'Do not complain
among yourselves. No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who
sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day. It is written
in the prophets, "And they shall all be taught by God." Everyone who has
heard and learned from the Father comes to me. Not that anyone has seen
the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father. Very
truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life. I am the bread of
life. Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they
died. This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat
of it and not die. I am the living bread that came down from heaven.
Whoever eats of this bread will live for ever; and the bread that I will
give for the life of the world is my flesh.'
