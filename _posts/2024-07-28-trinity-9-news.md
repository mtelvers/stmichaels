A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael's. If you are new to St Michael's, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so we can welcome
you properly.

**PRAYER REQUEST SLIPS** are available at the back of church if you want
to request prayer for yourself, for someone else or for a particular
situation.

**SERVICES THIS WEEK:** Mass on Thursday at 10.30am. Next Sunday Sung
Mass at 10.30am.

**SAINTS FOR THIS WEEK:** On Monday the Church celebrates Mary, Martha
and Lazarus of Bethany. This family of two sisters and a brother were
very supportive friends of Jesus. Bethany lies just outside Jerusalem
and Jesus stayed with this family during Holy Week, going into Jerusalem
by day. Jesus' raising of Lazarus is the occasion for his words to
Martha: "I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me,
even though they die, will live."

On Tuesday we remember **William Wilberforce**. Born in 1759, he was a
strong Evangelical determined to work for Christ through serving in
Parliament. He is best remembered for his crusade against slavery. The
trade in slaves was made illegal in the British Empire in 1807, and
Wilberforce lived to see the complete abolition of slavery in 1807.

Wednesday is the Feast Day of **St Ignatius of Loyola**, 16th century
founder of the Jesuits. His teaching on spirituality and methods of
prayerful reflection have spread widely and been found helpful by many
Christians in our own day.

**THIS SUNDAY** we travel over towards Canterbury to join our friends at
St Michael's Harbledown for the BBQ at 3pm followed by Evensong and
Benediction at 6pm. We have a good number going but more would be
welcome.

**MASS OF OUR LADY OF WALSINGHAM** -- Please note the date. There will
be a Mass of OLW in Church on Saturday 17th August at 10.30am.
This will be the first of our Monthly Masses of OLW, and after this Mass
we will formally set up our Cell of OLW at St Michael's. All will be
welcome at the Mass, whether you intend to be a member of the Cell or
not.

The Cell is a group of lay and ordained people at St Michael's who will
meet regularly to offer Mass in honour of Mary, to pray for the work of
the Shrine at Walsingham, and to pray especially for the development of
our mission and ministry at St Michael's, asking Mary's prayers for all
that we do and offering prayer for those on our sick list. I regard
this as a very important initiative, which was proposed by Fr Paul,
and which reminds us that our Mission and Ministry needs to be
underpinned by prayer if it is to flourish under God's guidance.
Interested? Just ask!

**FOR OUR PRAYERS:** This week we pray for the success of the Olympic
Games, that they will remain true to the best ideals of the Olympics and
give joy to those who participate and watch. We pray for those who work
to combat modern slavery and those who provide safe houses for people in
need of a place of safety. In our Church life, we give thanks for our
Bellringers, for the joy they bring to those who hear the bells, and for
their witness to an ongoing Christian faith in this Parish. We pray for
the establishment of a Cell of Our Lady of Walsingham at St Michael's.

We pray for all those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis
Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Ellie Pointer, Rue McGeouch,
Frank Carr, Lindsay Wheeler, Peter Rowe, William Danes-Volkov, Martyn
Nash, Lisa Thompset, Fran, Keanna and Ellie Tomlinson.

We pray for the recently departed, for all those who faithfully
served God in this place in previous generations, and for those who's
year's mind occurs this week: Alan Cox, Dick van Seenus, James Adam
Orwin and Kenneth Jordan.
