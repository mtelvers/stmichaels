**OUR LENT CHARITY -- MARY'S MEALS**

Mary's Meals is a charity based in the Roman Catholic Church which
provides meals for children in school in the very poorest countries. In
this way they provide sustenance for children who otherwise would go
hungry, but in a way that also encourages children to attend school and
get an education which might lift them and their families out of
poverty. **Collections via Lent Boxes and our Lent Lunch on Sunday
16th March.**

**There are Lent Boxes and 'Tea Cups' at Back of Church** -- do please
take one home if you wish, and use it for your loose change and regular
donations throughout Lent. Bring it back full on Maundy Thursday !!

**NEW CHURCH ELECTORAL ROLL:** The box is still at back of church for
late delivery of Electoral Roll forms.

**ST MICHAEL'S PARISH PILGRIMAGE TO WALSINGHAM** **Tuesday 27th May --
Friday 30th May**. **Last call for applications to join our pilgrimage
-- forms and deposit to Fr John please.**

**MAIDSTONE HOMELESS CARE:** You will recall we supported MHC with our
gifts at Epiphany. They have sent me a summary of their work in
February: They had 242 visitors to the Day Centre, a 20% increase on
January. Visitors used showers, laundry and replacement clothing, and
151 meals were provided. There were 13 new guests presenting themselves
as homeless during the month. The most common reasons for someone
presenting as suddenly homeless are being released from prison with no
onward address, people with mental health issues, and relationship
breakdown. 164 people and families also received help at home with food
parcels during February.

**FOR OUR PRAYERS:** We pray that we would use Lent well as a time for
prayer, reading and reflection. We pray for our fractured world at a
time of uncertainty and crisis, especially for Ukraine and the Middle
East. We pray for the homeless and those in financial difficulty, and
for the work of MHC.

**We pray for those in need**, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis
Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O'Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler, Martyn
Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Alison Heywood, Norman
Farrington, Olga Danes-Volkov, Pope Francis.

**We pray for the recently departed, including John Mercer of our
congregation**. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this
Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year's mind
occurs this week: Ken Landi, Arabella Butcher, Ellen Earl, Peter Roots.
