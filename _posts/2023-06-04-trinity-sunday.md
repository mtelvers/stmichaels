**TRINITY SUNDAY Hymns 146, 159, 295, 358**

**FIRST READING Isaiah 40.12-17,27-31**

Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the
heavens with a span, enclosed the dust of the earth in a measure, and
weighed the mountains in scales and the hills in a balance? Who has
directed the spirit of the Lord, or as his counsellor has instructed
him? Whom did he consult for his enlightenment, and who taught him the
path of justice? Who taught him knowledge, and showed him the way of
understanding?

Even the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as
dust on the scales; see, he takes up the isles like fine dust. Lebanon
would not provide fuel enough, nor are its animals enough for a
burnt-offering. All the nations are as nothing before him; they are
accounted before him as less than nothing and emptiness.

Why do you say, O Jacob, and speak, O Israel, 'My way is hidden from the
Lord, and my right is disregarded by my God'?

Have you not known? Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God,
the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary;
his understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and
strengthens the powerless. Even youths will faint and be weary, and the
young will fall exhausted; but those who wait for the Lord shall renew
their strength, they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall
run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 8**

**R: How great is your name, O Lord our God, through all the earth!**

When I see the heavens, the work of your hands, the moon and the stars which you arranged,  
what is man that you should keep him in mind, mortal man that you care for him? **R**

Yet you have made him little less than a god; with glory and honour you crowned him,  
gave him power over the works of your hands, put all things under his feet. **R**

All of them, sheep and cattle, yes, even the savage beasts,   
birds of the air, and fish that make their way through the waters. **R**

**SECOND READING 2 Corinthians 13.11-13**

Finally, brothers and sisters, farewell. Put things in order, listen to
my appeal, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love
and peace will be with you. Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the
saints greet you.

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion
of the Holy Spirit be with all of you.

**GOSPEL Matthew 28.16-20**

Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus
had directed them. When they saw him, they worshipped him; but some
doubted.

And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth
has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations,
baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy
Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you.
And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'
