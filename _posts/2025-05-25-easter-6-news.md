A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
THURSDAY THIS WEEK IS ASCENSION DAY, one of the great Feasts of Our Lord and a Holy Day of
Obligation. Mass for Ascension Day – 10.30am. We thank Fr Paul for coming to offer Mass for us on this Feast
Day, and for his visits to say Mass during my recent holiday. We are very grateful.

NEXT SUNDAY - Sung Mass with Confirmation at 10.30am, followed by Lunch in the Vestry Hall. All
welcome.




We look forward to the visit of Bishop Luke Irvine-Capel, Bishop of Richborough, to St Michaels NEXT
SUNDAY 1st June, to Celebrate Mass and administer the Sacrament of Confirmation for Zoe and Andy.

We want our Church to be at its very best for this important occasion in our life together, in praise to God as we
celebrate our faith with joy and thanksgiving.

We will be cleaning and preparing the Church and doing some gardening around the building on Saturday, and there is
a list at Back of Church so we know who will be coming to help – do please sign up if you can come, even if it is for
just half an hour, or to make tea for the other helpers. Many hands make light work !!

There is also a list at Back of Church for contributions to the lunch.

Thank you to those who have already volunteered to help in any way – it is much appreciated !!

Fr John.

FOR OUR PRAYERS:

We pray for Zoe Lee and Andy Brooks as they prepare to be Confirmed next Sunday; for Bishop Luke and for all
parishes and clergy under his care. We pray for Pope Leo XIV and for his ministry. We pray for the people of Gaza
and the Holy Land, for a cessation of war and violence on all sides, for the safe return of all hostages, and for the
resumption of meaningful supplies of food and medical aid to the people of Gaza. We pray for the Diocese of
Jerusalem, including the restoring of medical facilities and the buildings of the Al Ahli Anglican Hospital in Gaza.

We pray for our Parish Pilgrimage to Walsingham this week, for safe journeys and for a strengthening and renewal of
faith. Walsingham is a great and historic place of healing and renewal. May Our Lady of Walsingham richly bless our
pilgrims and the life of our Church here at St Michaels.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington, Trevor Joseph and Fr Derek
Mottershead.

We pray for the recently departed, including Beryl Haigh. We remember those who have faithfully served God in
this Church in previous generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Helen Margaret
Cardew, Andrea Parsons.
