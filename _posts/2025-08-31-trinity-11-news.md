A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's. Do please join us

HERITAGE OPEN DAY Saturday 13th September. As usual for HOD we will be opening the church from 10am –
4pm, with displays about the history, art and architecture of St Michaels. Our ringers will be ringing a peel in the
morning, Malcom will provide organ music from 2pm, and Oxford Organ Scholar Levente Vas will be giving
an organ recital at 3pm. Tea, coffee and cake throughout !! Do plan to come, tell others, and bring your friends
and neighbours, for this opportunity to appreciate our wonderful building, understand more of its history and
significance, and enjoy the sound of our bells and organ. If you can help provide a friendly welcome in church at some
point, or help with refreshments, do let myself or Eleanor know.

RIDE AND STRIDE Saturday 13th September. This coincides with Heritage Open Day and is an opportunity to
sponsor (or be sponsored) to walk or ride (bike or horse) visiting as many churches as you can on your journey. If you
opt to “Ride or Stride” the sponsorship you raise will be split between St Michaels Church and the Friends of Kent
Churches, which provides grants towards the maintenance of churches across the county. Our intrepid rider-and strider
Catherine Garland will once again be participating and is looking for sponsorship – do please support her – sponsor
forms at Back of Church. If you would like to join her in riding and striding, have a chat with Catherine.

SCHOOL GOVERNOR – ST MICHAELS PRIMARY AND JUNIOR. There is an opportunity for a committed
Christian to join the Governing Body of our St Michael’s schools as a Foundation Governor. If you might be
interested, or you know someone who might be, please speak to me. This is a very important role for our
schools and for local children and families. Fr John.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: For children returning to school, and especially those starting a new school. For teachers
and staff as they begin a new school year. For Wendy, staff and children at Wendy House pre-school that meets in our
church halls as they also begin a new year.
For all refugees and asylum seekers who come to our country seeking refuge, that they will find a humane welcome,
and respite from the fear and oppression from which they have fled. For the establishment of safe routes and rapid
assessment for genuine asylum seekers.
For Bishop Luke and all clergy and parishes under his care; that our churches may be places of sanctuary, healing and
spiritual comfort and growth for all who come seeking God’s help.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Peter Jordan, Daisy de Winton, George
Burbridge, Edna Francis.
