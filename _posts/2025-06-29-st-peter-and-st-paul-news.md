A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.

Today is the 30th Anniversary of the Priesting of Fr Paul Matthias. We offer him our
congratulations, and thank him for his devoted and inspiring ministry among us.
St Michael’s Church Summer Fete - Saturday 5th July. There is a box near the entrance to the Ascension chapel
for donations for the various stalls and activities – especially prizes for the Tombola and Raffle. If you can contribute
to or help with other stalls – plants and gardening, books and toys, cakes, crafts and gifts – have a word with Alison
Heywood or the stall organiser.

Setting Up in the halls will be from 6pm on Friday evening.

                               Note the date – come and enjoy – invite your friends !!


GIFT AID: If you give to St Michael’s through the envelope scheme or by direct debit and would like us to claim the
Gift Aid on your donations please complete a new Gift Aid form (available at Back of Church) and pop it into the
Box Provided (please do this even if you have completed a form in the past).

If you are a taxpayer, we can increase the amount of your donation / Sunday collection by reclaiming tax at no
cost to yourself. If this is you, and you aren’t yet a member of our regular giving scheme by envelope or bank
direct debit – do please have a chat with me. Fr John.

This Tuesday, 1st July, our Churchwardens Jonathan and Zoe will be admitted to office as our Churchwardens for
this year at a service at St Nicholas Church Allington, starting at 7pm and led by our new Interim Archdeacon. The
service is open to all, and it would be lovely if a good number of us attended to show support for Jonathan and Zoe.

Folkestone Blessing of the Fisheries with Bishop Luke is this afternoon from 2.45 on the seafront with the
Salvation Army Band, Afternoon Tea afterwards courtesy of St Peters Folkestone.

The Society Pilgrimage to Aylesford Priory: Saturday 30th August, Preacher Fr Ben Eadon, Priest Administrator at
Walsingham.

WALSINGHAM 2026: I have booked 12 places for our Walsingham Pilgrimage 26th – 29th May 2026. Please put
the dates in your diary NOW.

Walsingham 2025: Sue Hemmings has provided a beautiful book of photos from our pilgrimage this year – it is on
the desk at Back of Church. Do please have a look – especially if you have never been to Walsingham and want to see
more about it.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for those being ordained either as Deacon or to the Sacred Priesthood at this time.
We pray God’s blessing upon their future ministry, and upon the parishes they serve. We give thanks for 30 years of
Priestly Ministry by Fr Paul Matthias, not least here at St Michaels. We pray for God’s blessing on Zoe and Jonathan
as they are admitted to office as churchwardens and offer our support and help for all they do on our behalf.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Mollie Perkins, Dorothy Methven, Stella
Dixon, Mary Baxter.
