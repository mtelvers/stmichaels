**SUNDAY 1 JANUARY - THE NAMING OF JESUS HYMNS: 40, 33, 39, 31**

 

**FIRST READING: Numbers 6.22--27**

The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 'Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying,
"Thus you shall bless the Israelites: You shall say to them,

The LORD bless you and keep you; the LORD make his face to shine upon
you and be gracious to you; the LORD lift up his countenance upon you,
and give you peace."

So they shall put my name on the Israelites, and I will bless them.'

 

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 8**

 **R** **Your name, O Lord, is exalted in all the world!**

 1 O Lord our governor, how exalted is your name in all the world!

2 Out of the mouths of infants and children your majesty is praised
above the heavens.

3 You have set up a stronghold against your adversaries, to quell the
enemy and the avenger. **R**

4 When I consider your heavens, the work of your fingers,

the moon and the stars you have set in their courses,

5 What are mortals, that you should be mindful of them?

mere human beings, that you should seek them out?

6 You have made them little lower than the angels; you adorn them with
glory and honour. **R**

7 You give them mastery over the works of your hands; and put all things
under their feet,

8 All sheep and oxen, even the wild beasts of the field,

9 The birds of the air, the fish of the sea, and whatsoever walks in the
paths of the sea.

10 O Lord our governor, how exalted is your name in all the world! **R**

 

**SECOND READING: Galatians 4.4--7**

 When the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a woman,
born under the law, in order to redeem those who were under the law, so
that we might receive adoption as children. And because you are
children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying,
'Abba! Father!' So you are no longer a slave but a child, and, if a
child, then also an heir, through God.

 

**GOSPEL: Luke 2.15--21**

When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said
to one another, 'Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has
taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.'

So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying
in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told
them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the
shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered
them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God
for all they had heard and seen,

as it had been told them.

After eight days had passed, it was time to circumcise the child; and he
was called Jesus, the name given by the angel.

***NEWS FROM ST MICHAEL\'S***

***A Happy New Year and a warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to
visitors and newcomers to St Michael\'s, as we keep this Feast of the
Circumcision and Naming of Jesus. A special welcome to our celebrant Fr
Paul, who will also kindly celebrate Mass for us on Thursday at 10.30
am. If you are new to St Michael\'s, please join us for tea or coffee in
the Vestry Hall after Mass, so that we can welcome you properly.

**FREE copies of *Together*** can still be found at the back of the
church. Pick one up, take it home, discover more about other parishes
like our own, and use it in your prayers!

***From Practice to Perfect*** is the title of a new booklet issued by
the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers and dealing with how Church
Bell Ringers are trained, safeguarded and organised, as well as with
such seemingly basic questions as "Why ring?" If you Google the title,
you can find a copy online; PCC members and safeguarding officers should
find it particularly informative, but it will be appreciated by anyone
who has an interest in ringing, or who has a friend or family member who
would like to know more.

**The PCC meets on 12th January.** If you would like an item included in
the Agenda, please mention it as soon as possible to Paul or Eleanor.

**Help, please!** Please speak to Paul if you can **volunteer for
welcoming or refreshments** in the coming weeks. Also, while it has
become customary here to leave the Crib in place until Candlemas, we
shall be **dismantling the rest of the Christmas decorations** after
Epiphany, on Saturday 7^th^ January at 9 am. Any help will be most
welcome.

**A FREE Online Safeguarding Conference,** organised annually by the
dioceses of Canterbury and Rochester, takes place on 21^st^ January from
9 am to 12.30 pm. Everyone is invited, and you can book a ticket at
<https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/annual-conference-2023-partnerships-in-creating-safer-church-tickets-474612728447>.

**Church, School and Household** can and should come together to nourish
children and young people in their Christian faith. This is the message
and purpose of a new diocesan hub, **"Growing Faith"**, full of
resources for anyone who comes into contact with youngsters in whichever
context. You can find it at:
<https://canterburydiocese.org/childrenandyoungpeople/growing-faith/>.

**Parish Giving Scheme:** From small beginnings in Gloucester Diocese,
this now covers 34 dioceses including our own, and our parish is taking
steps to become part of it. It relieves treasurers of various
administrative burdens, notably the Gift Aid processing. Pilot parishes
have found it most helpful in maintaining their cash flow: in December
2022 the Scheme processed over 74 000 donations and £1.1 million in -
monthly - Gift Aid, the latter taking only a few days to reach church
bank accounts. We shall be hearing more about all this, but in the
meantime, there is explanation, and a chance to attend a January
information session, on the diocesan website: visit
