# COLLECT:

God of compassion, whose Son Jesus Christ, the child of Mary, shared
the life of a home in Nazareth, and on the cross drew the whole human
family to himself:

strengthen us in our daily living that in joy and in sorrow we may know
the power of your presence to bind together and to heal; through Jesus
Christ your Son our Lord, who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity
of the Holy Spirit, one God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Exodus 2: 1-10)

## A reading from the book of Exodus.

Now a man from the house of Levi went and married a Levite woman. The
woman conceived and bore a son; and when she saw that he was a fine
baby, she hid him for three months. When she could hide him no longer
she got a papyrus basket for him, and plastered it with bitumen and
pitch; she put the child in it and placed it among the reeds on the bank
of the river. His sister stood at a distance, to see what would happen
to him.

The daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, while her
attendants walked beside the river. She saw the basket among the reeds
and sent her maid to bring it. When she opened it, she saw the child. He
was crying, and she took pity on him. 'This must be one of the Hebrews'
children,' she said. Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, 'Shall
I go and get you a nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for
you?' Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Yes.' So the girl went and called
the child's mother. Pharaoh's daughter said to her, 'Take this child and
nurse it for me, and I will give you your wages.' So the woman took the
child and nursed it. When the child grew up, she brought him to
Pharaoh's daughter, and she took him as her son. She named him
Moses, 'because', she said, 'I drew him out of the water.'

# RESPONSORIAL PSALM (From Psalm 34)

## Response: The Lord is near to the broken-hearted.

1\. Come, O children, listen to me;\
   I will teach you the fear of the Lord.\
Which of you desires life,\
   and covets many days to enjoy good?\
Keep your tongue from evil,\
   and your lips from speaking deceit.\
Depart from evil, and do good;\
   seek peace, and pursue it. ***R.***

2\. The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous,\
   and his ears are open to their cry.\
The face of the Lord is against evildoers,\
   to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.\
When the righteous cry for help, the Lord hears,\
   and rescues them from all their troubles.\
The Lord is near to the broken-hearted,\
   and saves the crushed in spirit.  ***R.***

# SECOND READING (Colossians 3: 12-17)

## A reading from the letter of Paul to the Colossians.

As God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, clothe yourselves with
compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. Bear with one
another and, if anyone has a complaint against another, forgive each
other; just as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must
forgive. Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds everything
together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your
hearts, to which indeed you were called in the one body. And be
thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; teach and admonish
one another in all wisdom; and with gratitude in your hearts sing
psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs to God. And whatever you do, in word
or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to
God the Father through him.

# HOLY GOSPEL (John 19: 25-27)

Standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's
sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. When Jesus saw his
mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to
his mother, 'Woman, here is your son.' Then he said to the disciple,
'Here is your mother.' And from that hour the disciple took her into his
own home.
