This is the only Lewis Waters on Forces War Records and CWGC, so he may have had family in Maidstone. Ancestry tells us a different Lewis Waters was born in Maidstone in January 1887 â€“ his parents were Thomas and Patience Waters, but there is no evidence that he died serving in World War 1. If evidence of that can be found then he would be the soldier remembered on our Board.

parents: George Waters, of 29, Middle Lane, Epsom, and the late Esther Waters.
