**FOURTH SUNDAY IN ADVENT/CHRISTMAS EVE Hymns 14, 16, 272, 18**

**FIRST READING 2 Samuel 7.1-11,16** Now when the king was settled in
his house, and the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies around
him, the king said to the prophet Nathan, 'See now, I am living in a
house of cedar, but the ark of God stays in a tent.' Nathan said to the
king, 'Go, do all that you have in mind; for the Lord is with you.'

But that same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan: Go and tell my
servant David: Thus says the Lord: Are you the one to build me a house
to live in? I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the
people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in
a tent and a tabernacle. Wherever I have moved about among all the
people of Israel, did I ever speak a word with any of the tribal leaders
of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, 'Why
have you not built me a house of cedar?' Now therefore thus you shall
say to my servant David: Thus says the Lord of hosts: I took you from
the pasture, from following the sheep to be prince over my people
Israel; and I have been with you wherever you went, and have cut off all
your enemies from before you; and I will make for you a great name, like
the name of the great ones of the earth. And I will appoint a place for
my people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in their own
place, and be disturbed no more; and evildoers shall afflict them no
more, as formerly, from the time that I appointed judges over my people
Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. Moreover, the
Lord declares to you that the Lord will make you a house.

Your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever before me; your
throne shall be established for ever.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 89 *Response: I will sing for ever of your love, O
Lord. ***

1\. I will sing for ever of your love, O Lord; through all ages my mouth
will proclaim your truth.

Of this I am sure, that your love lasts for ever; that your truth is
firmly established as the heavens. ***R.***

2\. I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my
servant:

"I will establish your dynasty for ever: and set up your throne through
all ages." ***R.***

3\. He will say to me: "You are my father; my God, the rock who saves
me."

I will keep my love for him always; with him my covenant shall endure.
***R.***

**SECOND READING Romans 16.25-27** Now to God who is able to strengthen
you according to my gospel and the proclamation of Jesus Christ,
according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long
ages but is now disclosed, and through the prophetic writings is made
known to all the Gentiles, according to the command of the eternal God,
to bring about the obedience of faith--- to the only wise God, through
Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory for ever! Amen.

**GOSPEL Luke 1.26-38** In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by
God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man
whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was
Mary. And he came to her and said, 'Greetings, favoured one! The Lord is
with you.' But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what
sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, 'Do not be
afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And now, you will
conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He
will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord
God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign
over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no
end.' Mary said to the angel, 'How can this be, since I am a virgin?'
The angel said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the
power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be
born will be holy; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative
Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth
month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible
with God.' Then Mary said, 'Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it
be with me according to your word.' Then the angel departed from her.
