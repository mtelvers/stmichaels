***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. If you are new to St Michael\'s, do join us
for refreshments in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we can
welcome you properly.

**PLEASE NOTE: Because of a problem with the organ, it is unfortunately
impossible for our service of music and readings, planned for 5 pm this
(Sunday) afternoon, to take place.** We do, however, hope to be able to
plan similar services later in the year.

**Our Services:**

**Thursday 11th April - Mass at 10.30 am** in the Ascension Chapel; Fr
Paul is kindly celebrating.

**Next Sunday (14th April)** -- Sung Mass at 10.30 am.

**Renewed thanks** to all who contributed, in whatever way, to a
memorable Holy Week and Easter Day at St Michael\'s - among them
welcomers, servers, organists, singers, those who provided and served
the refreshments, those who created the magnificent Easter Garden,
readers, flower-arrangers, and our dedicated sacristan and sound
engineer. Fr John was particularly glad to have Fr Paul concelebrating
with him on Easter Day.

**The Parochial Church Council meets** briefly in church immediately
after Mass today to pass the Accounts. **Warmest thanks to Treasurer
Nelly,** who has had a particularly challenging time sorting out some
queries and getting the accounts audited.

**The Church Electoral Roll:** today is the closing date for any
amendments to the Electoral Roll. Please speak to Martyn immediately
after Mass -- he will be delighted to have your form. **Thank you,
Martyn!**

**More Forms! Our Annual Parochial Church Meeting takes place on April
28th after Mass.** There are nomination forms in the narthex for
offices we shall need to fill within the parish -- Churchwarden, Deanery
Synod member, PCC members -- though nominations can also be made at the
meeting.

**Make a Difference Maidstone (MADM)** is seeking an experienced
part-time Finance Manager -- exact hours and pay subject to negotiation.
Contact this fast-developing local charity for the job details.

**Family Trust** are seeking **volunteer leaders and cooks** to help
with two week-long camps (28th July-2nd August and 4th-11th
August) intended to enable young people aged 9 to 12 to explore the
Christian faith. Please contact Dean Colins (<dean@familytrust.org.uk>)
