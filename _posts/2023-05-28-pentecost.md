**PENTECOST (Whitsunday)**

**FIRST READING Acts 2.1-21**

When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.
And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent
wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. Divided
tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of
them. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in
other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.

Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in
Jerusalem. And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered,
because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each.
Amazed and astonished, they asked, 'Are not all these who are speaking
Galileans? And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native
language? Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia,
Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and
the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, both
Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs---in our own languages we hear
them speaking about God's deeds of power.'

All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, 'What does this
mean?' But others sneered and said, 'They are filled with new wine.'

But Peter, standing with the eleven, raised his voice and addressed
them: 'Men of Judea and all who live in Jerusalem, let this be known to
you, and listen to what I say. Indeed, these are not drunk, as you
suppose, for it is only nine o'clock in the morning. No, this is what
was spoken through the prophet Joel: *"In the last days it will be, God
declares, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons
and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,
and your old men shall dream dreams. Even upon my slaves, both men and
women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit; and they shall prophesy.
And I will show portents in the heaven above and signs on the earth
below, blood, and fire, and smoky mist. The sun shall be turned to
darkness and the moon to blood, before the coming of the Lord's great
and glorious day. Then everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall
be saved."*

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 104**

**Response: Send forth your Spirit, O Lord, and renew the face of the
earth.**

Bless the Lord, my soul: Lord God, how great you are.  
How many are your works, O Lord! The earth is full of your riches.  **R.**

You take back your spirit, they die: returning to the dust from which they came.  
You send forth your spirit, they are created: and you renew the face of the earth. **R.**

May the glory of the Lord last for ever! May the Lord rejoice in his works!  
May my thoughts be pleasing to him: I find my joy in the Lord. **R.**

**SECOND READING 1 Corinthians 12.3b-13**

No one can say 'Jesus is Lord' except by the Holy Spirit. Now there are
varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of
services, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of activities, but
it is the same God who activates all of them in everyone. To each is
given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good. To one is
given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the
utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith by
the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, to
another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the
discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another
the interpretation of tongues. All these are activated by one and the
same Spirit, who allots to each one individually just as the Spirit
chooses. For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the
members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body---Jews or
Greeks, slaves or free---and we were all made to drink of one Spirit.

**GOSPEL John 20.19-23**

When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the
doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of
the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, 'Peace be with you.'
After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the
disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. Jesus said to them again,
'Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.' When he
had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy
Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you
retain the sins of any, they are retained.'
