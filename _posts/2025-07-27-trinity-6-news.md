A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.

ORGAN RECITAL IN CHURCH: Saturday 9th August at 2.30pm followed by Afternoon Tea and Cakes.
The Recital will be given by Levente Vas, Organ Scholar at St Hughs College Oxford. Levente is a ‘local boy’ and in
2024 he was a winner at the Kent County Organist’s Association competition, and he studies organ with Francois
Cloete and Jacob Collins. Collection for our organ fund.
Do please spread the word around any of your friends and neighbours who might support this, and aim to come
yourself too. I hope this will be the first of many such events (we also have a recital planned as part of Heritage
Weekend).

This Thursday: The PCC meets in the Vestry Hall at 7.30pm.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for our PCC Meeting on Thursday, and for all who contribute to the mission and
ministry of our Church. We pray for peace in Gaza, for the leaders of peoples and nations that they would truly seek
the things that make for peace. For all those who remain in Gaza to provide relief and medical care in awful and
dangerous conditions. For those who risk their lives to make known the situation in Gaza in the absence of the media.

We pray for those in need, and especially Paul Jones, Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay
Wheeler, Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green and Norman Farrington.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: Alan Cox, Dick van Seenus, Jason Adam
Orwin.
