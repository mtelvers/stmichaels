**TRINITY 11 Hymns 385, 475, 273, 361**

Then Joseph could no longer control himself before all those who stood
by him, and he cried out, 'Send everyone away from me.' So no one stayed
with him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers. And he wept so
loudly that the Egyptians heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard
it. Joseph said to his brothers, 'I am Joseph. Is my father still
alive?' But his brothers could not answer him, so dismayed were they at
his presence.

Then Joseph said to his brothers, 'Come closer to me.' And they came
closer. He said, 'I am your brother Joseph, whom you sold into
Egypt. And now do not be distressed, or angry with yourselves, because
you sold me here; for God sent me before you to preserve life. For the
famine has been in the land these two years; and there are five more
years in which there will be neither ploughing nor harvest. God sent me
before you to preserve for you a remnant on earth, and to keep alive for
you many survivors. So it was not you who sent me here, but God; he has
made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house and ruler over
all the land of Egypt. Hurry and go up to my father and say to him,
"Thus says your son Joseph, God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down
to me, do not delay. You shall settle in the land of Goshen, and you
shall be near me, you and your children and your children's children, as
well as your flocks, your herds, and all that you have. I will provide
for you there---since there are five more years of famine to come---so
that you and your household, and all that you have, will not come to
poverty." And now your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that
it is my own mouth that speaks to you. You must tell my father how
greatly I am honoured in Egypt, and all that you have seen. Hurry and
bring my father down here.' Then he fell upon his brother Benjamin's
neck and wept, while Benjamin wept upon his neck. And he kissed all his
brothers and wept upon them; and after that his brothers talked with
him.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM 133 Response: How good it is when brothers dwell in
unity!**

Behold, how good and pleasant it is when brothers dwell in unity!

It is like the precious oil upon the head, running down upon the beard.
**R**

It is like the dew of Hermon, which falls on the mountains of Zion,

For there the Lord has commanded the blessing, life for evermore. **R**

**SECOND READING Romans 11.1-2a,29-32** I ask, then, has God rejected
his people? By no means! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of
Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin. God has not rejected his
people whom he foreknew. For the gifts and the calling of God are
irrevocable. Just as you were once disobedient to God but have now
received mercy because of their disobedience, so they have now been
disobedient in order that, by the mercy shown to you, they too may now
receive mercy. For God has imprisoned all in disobedience so that he may
be merciful to all.

**GOSPEL Matthew 15.21-28** Jesus left that place and went away to the
district of Tyre and Sidon. Just then a Canaanite woman from that region
came out and started shouting, 'Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David; my
daughter is tormented by a demon.' But he did not answer her at all. And
his disciples came and urged him, saying, 'Send her away, for she keeps
shouting after us.' He answered, 'I was sent only to the lost sheep of
the house of Israel.' But she came and knelt before him, saying, 'Lord,
help me.' He answered, 'It is not fair to take the children's food and
throw it to the dogs.' She said, 'Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the
crumbs that fall from their masters' table.' Then Jesus answered her,
'Woman, great is your faith! Let it be done for you as you wish.' And
her daughter was healed instantly.
