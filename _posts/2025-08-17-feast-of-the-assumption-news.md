Rochester Diocese. Mass at 11am, Preacher Fr Ben Eadon from Walsingham, followed by picnic lunch and Rosary
Walk at 2pm. Please bring your own picnic, and it is suggested a picnic chair so all pilgrims can gather as a group for

together of our faith.

SCHOOL GOVERNOR – ST MICHAELS PRIMARY AND JUNIOR. There is an opportunity for a committed
Christian to join the Governing Body of our St Michael’s schools as a Foundation Governor. If you might be
interested, please speak to me. This is a very important role for our schools and for local children. Fr John.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: We pray for the Canterbury Diocese FiF pilgrimage to Walsingham led by Fr Peter Harnden;
for the establishment of long term peace and security in Europe; for humanitarian aid and peace in Gaza.
Thanksgiving for a successful recital and Afternoon Tea last Saturday, and for the many opportunities we have of
celebrating our community life together and deepening our commitment to Christ.
