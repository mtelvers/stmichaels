***A very warm welcome*** to any new readers, and to visitors and
newcomers to St Michael\'s. A special welcome and thanks to Fr Paul
Matthias, our celebrant this morning, who will also kindly be saying
Mass for us on **Thursday at 10.30 am.** If you are new to St
Michael\'s, do join us in the Vestry Hall after the service, so that we
can welcome you properly.

**Thank you to everyone** who contributed time, effort, imagination and
cake to our Heritage Open Day!Particular thanks to Alison for taking
charge of the refreshments, to Sue for her lovely flower arrangements,
to Gareth for the wonderful organ music, to Sara for the children\'s
craft activity and to Martyn and Paul for dealing with unwieldy banners
and bunting. The amazing Catherine cycled around 20 churches in
blistering heat and has raised almost Â£400 in sponsor money, which will
be divided between the Friends of Kent Churches and St Michael\'s. Other
Riders and Striders from far and wide were signed in by Fr Paul and by
Mike and Mary. Meanwhile, friends and pupils of the Wendy House had a
lively time bouncing on a bouncy castle, having tea with a princess and
enjoying other attractions organised by Wendy and her helpers. Well
done, everybody!

**St Michael\'s is proud of its Tower** and its network of dedicated
ringers. In addition to the regular practices and various quarter-peals,
three peals are planned for the remaining months of 2023:

**Monday October 30th** in memory of Tom and Tony (time to be confirmed)

**A chance to support the Royal National Lifeboat Institution: there\'s
a box in the narthex for used stamps!** Please don\'t try to detach them
from the envelopes -- about an inch of envelope all round the stamp is
good if you can manage it.

**Michaelmas Lunch!** An opportunity to get together and celebrate our
patronal festival over a shared meal **after Mass on Sunday, October
1st.** Can **you** be an angel and start to think about some item of
food you would like to bring? A list will appear shortly - or have a
word with Alison.

**Other Michaelmas treats** are planned by other Resolution parishes in
this diocese - all visitors welcome:

**St Michael\'s, Harbledown -- Solemn Mass on 29th September** at 7
pm, followed by a buffet reception

**Holy Trinity, Ramsgate - Songs of Praise on 30th September** at 3

**A session of our Garden Working Party** takes place on Saturday 23^rd^
September from 9.30 am, the plan being to trim our hedge. **All helpers

**Our pre-Christmas Fair is planned for December 2nd** and Sara is
very kindly taking charge. For work reasons she can\'t always be here on
a Sunday, but will greatly welcome money-making ideas and offers of help
if you phone her on **07837 919761.** Let\'s make this another really
good St Michael\'s team effort.

**Great news for families with primary age boys: after a long break,
there will once more be Cubs and Beavers in our Vestry Hall.** In
addition, there will now be **Squirrels** -- for boys not yet old enough
for the Beaver colony. To learn more, come along to the opening night --
Monday, 18th September. Further information from Ralph.

**PCC meets on 20th September in the Vestry Hall at 7.30 pm.** If
