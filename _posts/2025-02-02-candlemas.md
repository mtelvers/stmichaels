# COLLECT

Almighty and ever-living God, clothed in majesty, whose
beloved Son was this day presented in the Temple in substance of our
flesh:

grant that we may be presented to you with pure and clean hearts, by
your Son Jesus Christ our Lord,

who is alive and reigns with you, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, one
God, now and for ever. Amen.

# FIRST READING (Malachi 3: 1-5)

## A reading from the prophet Malachi.

See, I am sending my messenger to prepare the way before me, and the
Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple. The messenger of
the covenant in whom you delight---indeed, he is coming, says
the Lord of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can
stand when he appears?

For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap; he will sit as a
refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the descendants of
Levi and refine them like gold and silver, until they present offerings
to the Lord in righteousness. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem
will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and as in former
years.

Then I will draw near to you for judgement; I will be swift to bear
witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who
swear falsely, against those who oppress the hired workers in their
wages, the widow, and the orphan, against those who thrust aside the
alien, and do not fear me, says the Lord of hosts.

# SECOND READING (Hebrews 2: 14-end)

## A reading from the letter to the Hebrews.

Since, therefore, the children share flesh and blood, he himself
likewise shared the same things, so that through death he might destroy
the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those
who all their lives were held in slavery by the fear of death. For it is
clear that he did not come to help angels, but the descendants of
Abraham. Therefore he had to become like his brothers and sisters in
every respect, so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest
in the service of God, to make a sacrifice of atonement for the sins of
the people. Because he himself was tested by what he suffered, he is
able to help those who are being tested.

# HOLY GOSPEL (Luke 2: 22-40)

When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses,
they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is
written in the law of the Lord, 'Every firstborn male shall be
designated as holy to the Lord'), and they offered a sacrifice according
to what is stated in the law of the Lord, 'a pair of turtle-doves or two
young pigeons.'

Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was
righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and
the Holy Spirit rested on him. It had been revealed to him by the Holy
Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord's
Messiah. Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the
parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary
under the law, Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,\
'Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,\
   according to your word;\
for my eyes have seen your salvation,\
   which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,\
a light for revelation to the Gentiles\
   and for glory to your people Israel.'

And the child's father and mother were amazed at what was being said
about him. Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, 'This
child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and
to be a sign that will be opposed so that the inner thoughts of many
will be revealed---and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'

There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of
Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband for seven
years after her marriage, then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She
never left the temple but worshipped there with fasting and prayer night
and day. At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak
about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.

When they had finished everything required by the law of the Lord, they
returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. The child grew and
became strong, filled with wisdom; and the favour of God was upon him.
