A very warm welcome to any new readers, and to visitors and newcomers to St Michael's.
A VERY BIG ‘THANK YOU’ to everyone who contributed to our Summer Fete, which raised a fantastic £876. Just
as important, it was a hugely enjoyable day which drew in many folk from our Parish and beyond.

GIFT AID: We still need ALL those who give regularly by Standing Order or through the envelope scheme to
complete a new Gift Aid form (available at Back of Church) and pop it into the Box provided. Very few of you have
submitted your forms yet.

Our Treasurer Wendy has just submitted a Gift Aid claim to HMRC for a payment to us of £6,000 – It is money that
HMRC offers to us free if only YOU sign up….So it is well worth doing if you are able to.

If you are a taxpayer and want to allow us to reclaim this tax from your donations – do have a chat with me. Fr
John.

EVENTS FOR US TO PARTICIPATE IN:

Sunday Afternoon 27th July – FiF BBQ, Solemn Evensong and Benediction, Harbledown. Details at Back of
