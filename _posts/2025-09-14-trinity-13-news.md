THANK YOU TO All who helped with Heritage Open Day and Ride and Stride, and especially to our Ringers and to

SUNDAY 28TH SEPTEMBER is our PATRONAL FESTIVAL, the Feast of St Michael and All Angels – A Sung
Festival Mass at 10.30am followed by a Bring-and-Share Parish Lunch in our Hall. Please note the date and hope to
come!! There is a list at Back of Church for you to indicate what you intend to bring towards the lunch.

The following Sunday, 5th October, will be our celebration of Harvest Festival with a collection of goods for
Maidstone Homeless Care.

FOR OUR PRAYERS: For our Open Day, and for all who came into our church building – that they will have seen a
glimpse of the love of God and be drawn to find out more. For all who live or work in our Parish. For peace
throughout the world, in our nation and community, and in our hearts. For Bishop Luke and all the parishes and clergy
under his care, and especially parishes in vacancy.

We pray for those in need, and especially Glynis Reynolds, Yvonne Young, Jessica O’Sullivan, Lindsay Wheeler,
Martyn Nash, Fran, Ellie Tomlinson, David Green, Norman Farrington, Chris Jenkins, Bridget Humphries and Bob
Humphries.

We pray for the recently departed. We remember those who have faithfully served God in this Church in previous
generations, and we pray for those whose year’s mind occurs this week: George Mason, Marguerite Hart, Opal
Fallows.
