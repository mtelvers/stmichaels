**ADVENT SUNDAY Hymns 3, 9, 298, 5**

**FIRST READING Isaiah 64.1-9** O that you would tear open the heavens
and come down, so that the mountains would quake at your presence--- as
when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil--- to make
your name known to your adversaries, so that the nations might tremble
at your presence! When you did awesome deeds that we did not expect, you
came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.

From ages past no one has heard, no ear has perceived, no eye has seen
any God besides you, who works for those who wait for him. You meet
those who gladly do right, those who remember you in your ways.

But you were angry, and we sinned; because you hid yourself we
transgressed. We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our
righteous deeds are like a filthy cloth. We all fade like a leaf, and
our iniquities, like the wind, take us away. There is no one who calls
on your name, or attempts to take hold of you; for you have hidden your
face from us, and have delivered us into the hand of our iniquity.

Yet, O Lord, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you are our
potter; we are all the work of your hand. Do not be exceedingly angry, O
Lord, and do not remember iniquity for ever. Now consider, we are all
your people.

**RESPONSORIAL PSALM** **80**

***Response: God of hosts, bring us back; let your face shine on us and
we shall be saved.***

1\. O shepherd of Israel, hear us: shine forth from your cherubim throne

O Lord, rouse up your might: O Lord, come to our help. **R.**

2\. God of hosts, turn again, we implore: look down from heaven and see.

Visit this vine and protect it: the vine your right hand has planted. R.

3\. May your hand be on the man you have chosen: the man you have given
your strength

And we shall never forsake you again: give us life that we may call upon
your name. R.

**SECOND READING 1 Corinthians 1.3-9** Grace to you and peace from God
our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I give thanks to my God always for
you because of the grace of God that has been given you in Christ Jesus,
for in every way you have been enriched in him, in speech and knowledge
of every kind--- just as the testimony of Christ has been strengthened
among you--- so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift as you
wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ. He will also strengthen
you to the end, so that you may be blameless on the day of our Lord
Jesus Christ. God is faithful; by him you were called into the
fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.

**GOSPEL Mark 13.24-37** 'But in those days, after that suffering, the
sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the
stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be
shaken. Then they will see "the Son of Man coming in clouds" with great
power and glory. Then he will send out the angels, and gather his elect
from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven.
'From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes
tender and puts forth its leaves, you know that summer is near. So also,
when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the
very gates. Truly I tell you, this generation will not pass away until
all these things have taken place. Heaven and earth will pass away, but
my words will not pass away. 'But about that day or hour no one knows,
neither the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Beware,
keep alert; for you do not know when the time will come. It is like a
man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his slaves in
charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to be on the
watch. Therefore, keep awake---for you do not know when the master of
the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or at cockcrow, or
at dawn, or else he may find you asleep when he comes suddenly. And what
I say to you I say to all: Keep awake.'
